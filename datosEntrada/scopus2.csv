With the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people now can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of activity in the area, of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. This survey covers techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking systems. Our focus is on methods that seek to address the new challenges raised by sentiment-aware applications, as compared to those that are already present in more traditional fact-based analysis. We include material on summarization of evaluative text and on broader issues regarding privacy, manipulation, and economic impact that the development of opinion-oriented information-access services gives rise to. To facilitate future work, a discussion of available resources, benchmark datasets, and evaluation campaigns is also provided.",,Mining; Benchmark datasets; Direct response; Economic impacts; Future work; Information-seeking; New opportunities; On methods; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Benchmarking,2-s2.0-48449095896

Does this also apply to societies at large, i.e. can societies experience mood states that affect their collective decision making? By extension is the public mood correlated or even predictive of economic indicators? Here we investigate whether measurements of collective mood states derived from large-scale Twitter feeds are correlated to the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over time. We analyze the text content of daily Twitter feeds by two mood tracking tools, namely OpinionFinder that measures positive vs. negative mood and Google-Profile of Mood States (GPOMS) that measures mood in terms of 6 dimensions (Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital, Kind, and Happy). We cross-validate the resulting mood time series by comparing their ability to detect the public's response to the presidential election and Thanksgiving day in 2008. A Granger causality analysis and a Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Network are then used to investigate the hypothesis that public mood states, as measured by the OpinionFinder and GPOMS mood time series, are predictive of changes in DJIA closing values. Our results indicate that the accuracy of DJIA predictions can be significantly improved by the inclusion of specific public mood dimensions but not others. We find an accuracy of 86.7% in predicting the daily up and down changes in the closing values of the DJIA and a reduction of the Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) by more than 6%. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Collective mood; Sentiment tracking; Social networks; Stock market,Behavioral economics; Collective decision making; Collective mood; Dow Jones Industrial averages; Economic indicators; Granger Causality; Individual behavior; Percentage error; Presidential election; Profile of mood state; Public mood; Self-organizing fuzzy neural network; Sentiment tracking; Social Networks; Stock market; Text content; Commerce; Decision making; Finance; Fuzzy neural networks; Social networking (online); Time series; Time series analysis; Economics,2-s2.0-79953102821

This study uses the context of the German federal election to investigate whether Twitter is used as a forum for political deliberation and whether online messages on Twitter validly mirror offline political sentiment. Using LIWC text analysis software, we conducted a contentanalysis of over 100,000 messages containing a reference to either a political party or a politician. Our results show that Twitter is indeed used extensively for political deliberation. We find that the mere number of messages mentioning a party reflects the election result. Moreover, joint mentions of two parties are in line with real world political ties and coalitions. An analysis of the tweets' political sentiment demonstrates close correspondence to the parties' and politicians' political positions indicating that the content of Twitter messages plausibly reflects the offline political landscape. We discuss the use of microblogging message content as a valid indicator of political sentiment and derive suggestions for further research.

This task represents an interesting twist on standard multi-class text categorization because there are several different degrees of similarity between class labels; for example, .three stars. is intuitively closer to .four stars. than to .one star.. We first evaluate human performance at the task. Then, we apply a metaalgorithm, based on a metric labeling formulation of the problem, that alters a given n-ary classifier's output in an explicit attempt to ensure that similar items receive similar labels.

In this paper, we focus on customer reviews of products. In particular, we study the problem of determining the semantic orientations (positive, negative or neutral) of opinions expressed on product features in reviews. This problem has many applications, e.g., opinion mining, summarization and search. Most existing techniques utilize a list of opinion (bearing) words (also called opinion lexicon) for the purpose. Opinion words are words that express desirable (e.g., great, amazing, etc.) or undesirable (e.g., bad, poor, etc) states. These approaches, however, all have some major shortcomings. In this paper, we propose a holistic lexicon-based approach to solving the problem by exploiting external evidences and linguistic conventions of natural language expressions. This approach allows the system to handle opinion words that are context dependent, which cause major difficulties for existing algorithms. It also deals with many special words, phrases and language constructs which have impacts on opinions based on their linguistic patterns. It also has an effective function for aggregating multiple conflicting opinion words in a sentence. A system, called Opinion Observer, based on the proposed technique has been implemented. Experimental results using a benchmark product review data set and some additional reviews show that the proposed technique is highly effective. It outperforms existing methods significantly. © 2008 ACM.",Context dependent opinions; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis,Blogs; Context dependent opinions; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Customer satisfaction; Problem solving; Search engines; Semantics; User interfaces; World Wide Web; Data mining,2-s2.0-42549170653

We suggest and evaluate a complementary ""infoveillance"" approach using Twitter during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Our study aimed to: 1) monitor the use of the terms ""H1N1"" versus ""swine flu"" over time; 2) conduct a content analysis of ""tweets""; and 3) validate Twitter as a real-time content, sentiment, and public attention trend-tracking tool. Methodology/Principal Findings: Between May 1 and December 31, 2009, we archived over 2 million Twitter posts containing keywords ""swine flu,"" ""swineflu,"" and/or ""H1N1."" using Infovigil, an infoveillance system. Tweets using ""H1N1"" increased from 8.8% to 40.5% (R2 =.788; p&lt;.001), indicating a gradual adoption of World Health Organizationrecommended terminology. 5,395 tweets were randomly selected from 9 days, 4 weeks apart and coded using a tri-axial coding scheme. To track tweet content and to test the feasibility of automated coding, we created database queries for keywords and correlated these results with manual coding. Content analysis indicated resource-related posts were most commonly shared (52.6%). 4.5% of cases were identified as misinformation. News websites were the most popular sources (23.2%), while government and health agencies were linked only 1.5% of the time. 7/10 automated queries correlated with manual coding. Several Twitter activity peaks coincided with major news stories. Our results correlated well with H1N1 incidence data. Conclusions: This study illustrates the potential of using social media to conduct ""infodemiology"" studies for public health. 2009 H1N1-related tweets were primarily used to disseminate information from credible sources, but were also a source of opinions and experiences. Tweets can be used for real-time content analysis and knowledge translation research, allowing health authorities to respond to public concerns. © 2010 Chew et al.",,"accuracy; article; automation; coding; content analysis; emoticon; epidemic; facial expression; frustration; human; humor; incidence; influenza A (H1N1); information dissemination; Internet; nomenclature; pandemic influenza; personal experience; social network; trend study; Twitter; influenza; Influenza virus A H1N1; mass medium; pandemic; statistics; Suidae; Clinical Coding; Communications Media; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza, Human; Pandemics; Terminology as Topic",2-s2.0-78649725192

EWGA is designed to improve performance and get a better assessment of key features. The proposed features and techniques are evaluated on a benchmark movie review dataset and U.S. and Middle Eastern Web forum postings. The experimental results using EWGA with SVM indicate high performance levels, with accuracies of over 91% on the benchmark dataset as well as the U.S. and Middle Eastern forums.

However, the high volume of reviews that are typically published for a single product makes harder for individuals as well as manufacturers to locate the best reviews and understand the true underlying quality of a product. In this paper, we reexamine the impact of reviews on economic outcomes like product sales and see how different factors affect social outcomes such as their perceived usefulness. Our approach explores multiple aspects of review text, such as subjectivity levels, various measures of readability and extent of spelling errors to identify important text-based features. In addition, we also examine multiple reviewer-level features such as average usefulness of past reviews and the self-disclosed identity measures of reviewers that are displayed next to a review. Our econometric analysis reveals that the extent of subjectivity, informativeness, readability, and linguistic correctness in reviews matters in influencing sales and perceived usefulness. Reviews that have a mixture of objective, and highly subjective sentences are negatively associated with product sales, compared to reviews that tend to include only subjective or only objective information. However, such reviews are rated more informative (or helpful) by other users. By using Random Forest-based classifiers, we show that we can accurately predict the impact of reviews on sales and their perceived usefulness. We examine the relative importance of the three broad feature categories: reviewer-related features, review subjectivity features, and review readability features, and find that using any of the three feature sets results in a statistically equivalent performance as in the case of using all available features. This paper is the first study that integrates econometric, text mining, and predictive modeling techniques toward a more complete analysis of the information captured by user-generated online reviews in order to estimate their helpfulness and economic impact. © 2011 IEEE.",economics; Internet commerce; online communities; product reviews; sentiment analysis; social media; textmining; user-generated content; word-of-mouth,Online communities; Product reviews; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Text-mining; User-generated content; word-of-mouth; Data mining; Decision trees; Internet; Natural language processing systems; Sales; Telecommunication networks; Economic and social effects,2-s2.0-80051798115

In Twitter, popular information that is deemed important by the community propagates through the network. Studying the characteristics of content in the messages becomes important for a number of tasks, such as breaking news detection, personalized message recommendation, friends recommendation, sentiment analysis and others. While many researchers wish to use standard text mining tools to understand messages on Twitter, the restricted length of those messages prevents them from being employed to their full potential. We address the problem of using standard topic models in microblogging environments by studying how the models can be trained on the dataset. We propose several schemes to train a standard topic model and compare their quality and effectiveness through a set of carefully designed experiments from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. We show that by training a topic model on aggregated messages we can obtain a higher quality of learned model which results in significantly better performance in two realworld classification problems.

Using the top 30 events, determined by a measure of relative increase in (general) term usage, the results give strong evidence that popular events are normally associated with increases in negative sentiment strength and some evidence that peaks of interest in events have stronger positive sentiment than the time before the peak. It seems that many positive events, such as the Oscars, are capable of generating increased negative sentiment in reaction to them.

Although most sentiment analysis addresses commercial tasks, such as extracting opinions from product reviews, there is increasing interest in the affective dimension of the social web, and Twitter in particular. Most sentiment analysis algorithms are not ideally suited to this task because they exploit indirect indicators of sentiment that can reflect genre or topic instead. Hence, such algorithms used to process social web texts can identify spurious sentiment patterns caused by topics rather than affective phenomena. This article assesses an improved version of the algorithm SentiStrength for sentiment strength detection across the social web that primarily uses direct indications of sentiment. The results from six diverse social web data sets (MySpace, Twitter, YouTube, Digg, Runners World, BBC Forums) indicate that SentiStrength 2 is successful in the sense of performing better than a baseline approach for all data sets in both supervised and unsupervised cases.

However, most of the reviews are plain text and thus require much effort to obtain information about relevant details. In this paper, we tackle the problem of automatically discovering what aspects are evaluated in reviews and how sentiments for different aspects are expressed. We first propose Sentence-LDA (SLDA), a probabilistic generative model that assumes all words in a single sentence are generated from one aspect. We then extend SLDA to Aspect and Sentiment Unification Model (ASUM), which incorporates aspect and sentiment together to model sentiments toward different aspects. ASUM discovers pairs of {aspect, sentiment} which we call senti-aspects. We applied SLDA and ASUM to reviews of electronic devices and restaurants. The results show that the aspects discovered by SLDA match evaluative details of the reviews, and the senti-aspects found by ASUM capture important aspects that are closely coupled with a sentiment. The results of sentiment classification show that ASUM outperforms other generative models and comes close to supervised classification methods. One important advantage of ASUM is that it does not require any sentiment labels of the reviews, which are often expensive to obtain.

In this paper, we focus on target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification; namely, given a query, we classify the sentiments of the tweets as positive, negative or neutral according to whether they contain positive, negative or neutral sentiments about that query. Here the query serves as the target of the sentiments. The state-of-the-art approaches for solving this problem always adopt the target-independent strategy, which may assign irrelevant sentiments to the given target. Moreover, the state-of-the-art approaches only take the tweet to be classified into consideration when classifying the sentiment; they ignore its context (i.e., related tweets). However, because tweets are usually short and more ambiguous, sometimes it is not enough to consider only the current tweet for sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose to improve target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification by 1) incorporating target-dependent features; and 2) taking related tweets into consideration. According to the experimental results, our approach greatly improves the performance of target-dependent sentiment classification. © 2011 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; State-of-the-art approach; Computational linguistics; Social networking (online),2-s2.0-83055184650

For this purpose data were compiled from four waves of the Eurobarometer surveys for 12 countries that provided detailed and comparable information on attitudes toward foreigners between 1988 and 2000. A series of multilevel hierarchical linear models were estimated to examine change in the effects of individual- and country-level sources of threat on anti-foreigner sentiment. The analysis shows a substantial rise in anti-foreigner sentiment between 1988 and 2000 in all 12 countries. The rise in anti-foreigner sentiment was steep in the early period (between 1988 and 1994), then leveled off after that. Although anti-foreigner sentiment tends to be more pronounced in places with a large proportion of foreign populations and where economic conditions are less prosperous, the effects of both factors on anti-foreigner sentiment have not changed over time. The analysis also shows that anti-foreigner sentiment is more pronounced in places with greater support for right-wing extreme parties. The impact of individual-level socioeconomic characteristics such as education has remained stable over the years, but the effect of political ideology has increased.

However, the contextual polarity of the phrase in which a particular instance of a word appears may be quite different from the word's prior polarity. Positive words are used in phrases expressing negative sentiments, or vice versa. Also, quite often words that are positive or negative out of context are neutral in context, meaning they are not even being used to express a sentiment. The goal of this work is to automatically distinguish between prior and contextual polarity, with a focus on understanding which features are important for this task. Because an important aspect of the problem is identifying when polar terms are being used in neutral contexts, features for distinguishing between neutral and polar instances are evaluated, as well as features for distinguishing between positive and negative contextual polarity. The evaluation includes assessing the performance of features across multiple machine learning algorithms. For all learning algorithms except one, the combination of all features together gives the best performance. Another facet of the evaluation considers how the presence of neutral instances affects the performance of features for distinguishing between positive and negative polarity. These experiments show that the presence of neutral instances greatly degrades the performance of these features, and that perhaps the best way to improve performance across all polarity classes is to improve the system's ability to identify when an instance is neutral. © 2009 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,,2-s2.0-70349529656

One such type of information consists of cues to the speaker's personality traits, the most fundamental dimension of variation between humans. Recent work explores the automatic detection of other types of pragmatic variation in text and conversation, such as emotion, deception, speaker charisma, dominance, point of view, subjectivity, opinion and sentiment. Personality affects these other aspects of linguistic production, and thus personality recognition may be useful for these tasks, in addition to many other potential applications. However, to date, there is little work on the automatic recognition of personality traits. This article reports experimental results for recognition of all Big Five personality traits, in both conversation and text, utilising both self and observer ratings of personality. While other work reports classification results, we experiment with classification, regression and ranking models. For each model, we analyse the effect of different feature sets on accuracy. Results show that for some traits, any type of statistical model performs significantly better than the baseline, but ranking models perform best overall. We also present an experiment suggesting that ranking models are more accurate than multi-class classifiers for modelling personality. In addition, recognition models trained on observed personality perform better than models trained using self-reports, and the optimal feature set depends on the personality trait. A qualitative analysis of the learned models confirms previous findings linking language and personality, while revealing many new linguistic markers. © 2007 AI Access Foundation.

In this article, we study two important problems, namely, opinion lexicon expansion and opinion target extraction. Opinion targets (targets, for short) are entities and their attributes on which opinions have been expressed. To perform the tasks, we found that there are several syntactic relations that link opinion words and targets. These relations can be identified using a dependency parser and then utilized to expand the initial opinion lexicon and to extract targets. This proposed method is based on bootstrapping. We call it double propagation as it propagates information between opinion words and targets. A key advantage of the proposed method is that it only needs an initial opinion lexicon to start the bootstrapping process. Thus, the method is semi-supervised due to the use of opinion word seeds. In evaluation, we compare the proposed method with several state-of-the-art methods using a standard product review test collection.

When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: They lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, ""powerful,"" ""strong"" and ""Paris"" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of- words models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperforms bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations.

The task is technically challenging and practically very useful. For example, businesses always want to find public or consumer opinions about their products and services. Potential customers also want to know the opinions of existing users before they use a service or purchase a product. With the explosive growth of social media (i.e., reviews, forum discussions, blogs and social networks) on the Web, individuals and organizations are increasingly using public opinions in these media for their decision making. However, finding and monitoring opinion sites on the Web and distilling the information contained in them remains a formidable task because of the proliferation of diverse sites. Each site typically contains a huge volume of opinionated text that is not always easily deciphered in long forum postings and blogs. The average human reader will have difficulty identifying relevant sites and accurately summarizing the information and opinions contained in them. Moreover, it is also known that human analysis of text information is subject to considerable biases, e.g., people often pay greater attention to opinions that are consistent with their own preferences. People also have difficulty, owing to their mental and physical limitations, producing consistent results when the amount of information to be processed is large. Automated opinion mining and summarization systems are thus needed, as subjective biases and mental limitations can be overcome with an objective sentiment analysis system. In the past decade, a considerable amount of research has been done in academia [58,76]. There are also numerous commercial companies that provide opinion mining services. In this chapter, we first define the opinion mining problem. From the definition, we will see the key technical issues that need to be addressed. We then describe various key mining tasks that have been studied in the research literature and their representative techniques. After that, we discuss the issue of detecting opinion spam or fake reviews.

It has a rich set of applications, ranging from tracking users' opinions about products or about political candidates as expressed in online forums, to customer relationship management. Functional to the extraction of opinions from text is the determination of the orientation of ""subjective"" terms contained in text, i.e. the determination of whether a term that carries opinionated content has a positive or a negative connotation. In this paper we present a new method for determining the orientation of subjective terms. The method is based on the quantitative analysis of the glosses of such terms, i.e. the definitions that these terms are given in on-line dictionaries, and on the use of the resulting term representations for semi-supervised term classification. The method we present outperforms all known methods when tested on the recognized standard benchmarks for this task.

The existing literature typically incorporates the impact of product reviews on sales based on numeric variables representing the valence and volume of reviews. In this paper, we posit that the information embedded in product reviews cannot be captured by a single scalar value. Rather, we argue that product reviews are multifaceted, and hence the textual content of product reviews is an important determinant of consumers' choices, over and above the valence and volume of reviews. To demonstrate this, we use text mining to incorporate review text in a consumer choice model by decomposing textual reviews into segments describing different product features. We estimate our model based on a unique data set from Amazon containing sales data and consumer review data for two different groups of products (digital cameras and camcorders) over a 15-month period. We alleviate the problems of data sparsity and of omitted variables by providing two experimental techniques: clustering rare textual opinions based on pointwise mutual information and using externally imposed review semantics. This paper demonstrates how textual data can be used to learn consumers' relative preferences for different product features and also how text can be used for predictive modeling of future changes in sales. © 2011 INFORMS.",Bayesian learning; Consumer reviews; Discrete choice; Econometrics; Electronic commerce; Electronic markets; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Text mining; User-generated content,Bayesian learning; Consumer reviews; Discrete choice; Econometrics; Electronic market; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Text mining; User-generated content; Cameras; Economics; Electronic commerce; Sales; Semantics; Video cameras; Data mining,2-s2.0-80051648956

However, it is hard, if not impossible, to collect and maintain a universal sentiment lexicon for all application domains because different words may be used in different domains. The main existing technique extracts such sentiment words from a large domain corpus based on different conjunctions and the idea of sentiment coherency in a sentence. In this paper, we propose a novel propagation approach that exploits the relations between sentiment words and topics or product features that the sentiment words modify, and also sentiment words and product features themselves to extract new sentiment words. As the method propagates information through both sentiment words and features, we call it double propagation. The extraction rules are designed based on relations described in dependency trees. A new method is also proposed to assign polarities to newly discovered sentiment words in a domain. Experimental results show that our approach is able to extract a large number of new sentiment words. The polarity assignment method is also effective.",,Application domains; Dependency trees; Different domains; Extraction rule; Large domain; Product feature; Sentiment analysis; Artificial intelligence; Feature extraction,2-s2.0-78751699461

Tracking such discussion on weblogs, provides useful insight on how to improve products or market them more effectively. An important component of such analysis is to characterize the sentiment expressed in blogs about specific brands and products. Sentiment Analysis focuses on this task of automatically identifying whether a piece of text expresses a positive or negative opinion about the subject matter. Most previous work in this area uses prior lexical knowledge in terms of the sentiment-polarity of words. In contrast, some recent approaches treat the task as a text classification problem, where they learn to classify sentiment based only on labeled training data. In this paper, we present a unified framework in which one can use background lexical information in terms of word-class associations, and refine this information for specific domains using any available training examples. Empirical results on diverse domains show that our approach performs better than using background knowledge or training data in isolation, as well as alternative approaches to using lexical knowledge with text classification.

Most existing algorithms for learning continuous word representations typically only model the syntactic context of words but ignore the sentiment of text. This is problematic for sentiment analysis as they usually map words with similar syntactic context but opposite sentiment polarity, such as good and bad, to neighboring word vectors. We address this issue by learning sentimentspecific word embedding (SSWE), which encodes sentiment information in the continuous representation of words. Specifically, we develop three neural networks to effectively incorporate the supervision from sentiment polarity of text (e.g. sentences or tweets) in their loss functions. To obtain large scale training corpora, we learn the sentiment-specific word embedding from massive distant-supervised tweets collected by positive and negative emoticons. Experiments on applying SSWE to a benchmark Twitter sentiment classification dataset in SemEval 2013 show that (1) the SSWE feature performs comparably with hand-crafted features in the top-performed system; (2) the performance is further improved by concatenating SSWE with existing feature set. © 2014 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,Algorithms; Benchmarking; Computational linguistics; Syntactics; Feature sets; Loss functions; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Training corpus; Word representations; Word vectors; Social networking (online),2-s2.0-84906924350

Using the overall density and precision of coherency in the corpus, the statistical estimation picks up appropriate polar atoms among candidates, without any manual tuning of the threshold values. The experimental results show that the precision of polarity assignment with the automatically acquired lexicon was 94% on average, and our method is robust for corpora in diverse domains and for the size of the initial lexicon. © 2006 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,Building methods; Diverse domains; Lexical entries; Manual tuning; Sentiment analysis; Statistical estimation; Syntactic structure; Use context; Atoms; Computational linguistics; Software agents; Natural language processing systems,2-s2.0-80053381476

We enumerate the challenges in emotion annotation in a crowdsourcing scenario and propose solutions to address them. Most notably, in addition to questions about emotions associated with terms, we show how the inclusion of a word choice question can discourage malicious data entry, help to identify instances where the annotator may not be familiar with the target term (allowing us to reject such annotations), and help to obtain annotations at sense level (rather than at word level). We conducted experiments on how to formulate the emotion-annotation questions, and show that asking if a term is associated with an emotion leads to markedly higher interannotator agreement than that obtained by asking if a term evokes an emotion. © 2012 National Research Council Canada.",affect; crowdsourcing; emotion lexicon; emotions; Mechanical Turk; polarity; polarity lexicon; semantic orientation; sentiment analysis; word-emotion associations,affect; Crowdsourcing; emotion lexicon; emotions; Mechanical turks; polarity; polarity lexicon; Semantic orientation; Sentiment analysis; Artificial intelligence; Computational methods; Semantics,2-s2.0-84881408290

Based on two data sets of more than 165,000 tweets in total, we find that emotionally charged Twitter messages tend to be retweeted more often and more quickly compared to neutral ones.

Yet, despite its potential importance, what characterizes recent cosmopolitanism research is an idealist sentiment that considerably marginalizes the significance of the structures of nation-state and citizenship, while leaving unspecified the empirical sociological dimensions of cosmopolitanism itself. Our critique aims at making cosmopolitanism a more productive analytical tool. We argue for a cosmopolitanism that consists of conceptually and empirically identifiable values and outlooks. While there has been some progress made in this direction in the recent literature on cosmopolitanism, most writing still considers cosmopolitanism as something so delicate that it cannot be measured. Furthermore, in order to appreciate the full currency of the concept, we argue that researchers must not only agree on some common determinants of cosmopolitanism and cosmopolitan dispositions, but also ground their analyses of cosmopolitanism in the context of enduring nation-state structures. © 2004, SAGE.

Second, we propose SentiBank, a novel visual concept detector library that can be used to detect the presence of 1,200 ANPs in an image. The VSO and SentiBank are dis- Tinct from existing work and will open a gate towards var- ious applications enabled by automatic sentiment analysis. Experiments on detecting sentiment of image tweets demon- strate significant improvement in detection accuracy when comparing the proposed SentiBank based predictors with the text-based approaches.

Despite emerging evidence to the contrary, the prevailing sentiment seems to be that crime displacement is inevitable. This study examined 102 evaluations of situationally focused crime-prevention projects in an effort to determine the extent to which crime displacement was observed. The results indicate that of the 102 studies that examined (or allowed for examination of) displacement and diffusion effects, there were 574 observations. Displacement was observed in 26 percent of those observations. The opposite of displacement, diffusion of benefit, was observed in 27 percent of the observations. Moreover, the analysis of 13 studies, which allowed for assessment of overall outcomes of the prevention project while taking into account spatial displacement and diffusion effects, revealed that when spatial displacement did occur, it tended to be less than the treatment effect, suggesting that the intervention was still beneficial.

Briefly, affect control theory proposes that individuals shape their social interactions so that emerging impressions reinforce sentiments about salient identities, behaviors, and settings. Emotions signal how the process of confirming sentiments is going for each individual. The theory explains behaviors, emotions, social labeling, and personality attributions in a wide variety of social contexts-including intimate relations, work-world interactions, courtrooms, and international relations. Part 1 of the book provides a plain-language exposition of the theory, along with numerous interpretive analyses of everyday situations. This is engaging and provocative reading for anyone interested in social relations, including undergraduates in and out of the social sciences. Part 2 presents the mathematical derivations that define sentiment-confirming behavior, labeling, attribution, and emotion. The mathematical solutions, conjoined with understandings about social institutions, are the basis of the theory's explanations. The derivations clarify the theory's assumptions and reasoning, as only mathematics can. Part 3 of Expressive Order describes the research program associated with the theory and the computer simulation software that is used in research. This part of the book offers a jump start for individuals wishing to use affect control theory in their own research. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC All rights reserved.",,,2-s2.0-84889823879

Users tend to express their real feelings freely in Twitter, which makes it an ideal source for capturing the opinions towards various interesting topics, such as brands, products or celebrities, etc. Naturally, people may anticipate an approach to receiving the common sentiment tendency towards these topics directly rather than through reading the huge amount of tweets about them. On the other side, Hashtags, starting with a symbol ""#"" ahead of keywords or phrases, are widely used in tweets as coarse-grained topics. In this paper, instead of presenting the sentiment polarity of each tweet relevant to the topic, we focus our study on hashtag-level sentiment classification. This task aims to automatically generate the overall sentiment polarity for a given hashtag in a certain time period, which markedly differs from the conventional sentence-level and document-level sentiment analysis. Our investigation illustrates that three types of information is useful to address the task, including (1) sentiment polarity of tweets containing the hashtag; (2) hashtags co-occurrence relationship and (3) the literal meaning of hashtags. Consequently, in order to incorporate the first two types of information into a classification framework where hashtags can be classified collectively, we propose a novel graph model and investigate three approximate collective classification algorithms for inference. Going one step further, we show that the performance can be remarkably improved using an enhanced boosting classification setting in which we employ the literal meaning of hashtags as semi-supervised information. Experimental results on a real-life data set consisting of 29,195 tweets and 2,181 hashtags show the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithms. © 2011 ACM.",graph-based classification; hashtag; sentiment analysis; twitter,Classification algorithm; Classification framework; Co-occurrence; Coarse-grained; Graph model; Graph-based; hashtag; Instant messages; One step; Real life data; Semi-supervised; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Time-periods; twitter; Algorithms; Data mining; Inference engines; Knowledge management; Social networking (online); Classification (of information),2-s2.0-83055179484

In countries such as the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, nationalism was pursued largely from the bottom up as ethnic and separatist movements. Some observers also take this bottom-up approach to find the major cause of Chinese nationalism and believe that ""the nationalist wave in China is a spontaneous public reaction to a series of international events, not a government propaganda."" (Zhang, M. (1997) The new thinking of Sino-US relations. Journal of Contemporary China, 6(14), 117-123). They see Chinese nationalism as ""a belated response to the talk of containing China among journalists and politicians"" in the United States and ""a public protest against the mistreatment from the US in the last several years."" (Li, H. (1997) China talks back: anti-Americanism or nationalism? Journal of Contemporary China, 6(14), 153-160). This position concurs with the authors of nationalistic books in China, such as The China That Can Say No: Political and Sentimental Choice in the Post-Cold War Era (Song, Q., Zhang Z., Qiao B. (1996) Zhongguo Keyi Shuo Bu (The China That Can Say No). Zhonghua Gongshang Lianhe Chubanshe. Beijing), which called upon Chinese political elites to say no to the US, and argue that the rise of nationalism was not a result of the official propaganda but a reflection of the state of mind of a new generation of Chinese intelligentsia in response to the foreign pressures in the post-Cold War era. Indeed, Chinese nationalism was mainly reactive sentiments to foreign suppressions in modern history, and this new wave of nationalist sentiment also harbored a sense of wounded national pride and an anti-foreign (particularly the US and Japan) resentment. Many Chinese intellectuals gave voice to a rising nationalistic discourse in the 1990s (Zhao, S. (1997) Chinese intellectuals' quest for national greatness and nationalistic writing in the 1990s. The China Quarterly, 152, 725-745). However, Chinese nationalism in the 1990s was also constructed and enacted from the top by the Communist state. There were no major military threats to China's security after the end of the Cold War. Instead, the internal legitimacy crisis became a grave concern of the Chinese Communist regime because of the rapid decay of Communist ideology. In response, the Communist regime substituted performance legitimacy provided by surging economic development and nationalist legitimacy provided by invocation of the distinctive characteristics of Chinese culture in place of Marxist-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. As one of the most important maneuvers to enact Chinese nationalism, the Communist government launched an extensive propaganda campaign of patriotic education after the Tiananmen Incident in 1989. The patriotic education campaign was well-engineered and appealed to nationalism in the name of patriotism to ensure loyalty in a population that was otherwise subject to many domestic discontents. The Communist regime, striving to maintain authoritarian control while Communist ideology was becoming obsolete in the post-Cold War era, warned of the existence of hostile international forces in the world perpetuating imperialist insult to Chinese pride. The patriotic education campaign was a state-led nationalist movement, which redefined the legitimacy of the post-Tiananmen leadership in a way that would permit the Communist Party's rule to continue on the basis of a non-Communist ideology. Patriotism was thus used to bolster CCP power in a country that was portrayed as besieged and embattled. The dependence on patriotism to build support for the government and the patriotic education campaign by the Communist propagandists were directly responsible for the nationalistic sentiment of the Chinese people in the mid-1990s. This paper focuses on the Communist state as the architect of nationalism in China and seeks to understand the rise of Chinese nationalism by examining the patriotic education campaign. It begins with an analysis of how nationalism took the place of the official ideology as the coalescing force in the post-Tiananmen years. It then goes on to examine the process, contents, methods and effectiveness of the patriotic education campaign. The conclusion offers a perspective on the instrumental aspect of state-led nationalism. © 1998 The Regents of the University of California.

Of 109 records reported in these surveys, a majority (51%) showed positive attitudes toward wolves and 60% supported wolf restoration. Attitudes toward wolves had a negative correlation with age, rural residence, and ranching and farming occupations, and positive correlation with education and income. Thirty-five percent of ranchers and farmers surveyed had positive attitudes toward wolves. Among surveys of the general population samples, 61% expressed positive attitudes. Surveys of environmental and wildlife groups showed an average of 69% support. Surveys in the lower 48 states showed higher proportions of positive attitudes than surveys in Scandinavia and Western Europe, where a majority did not support wolves. Among all surveys, 25% of respondents had neutral attitudes toward wolves. Positive attitudes toward wolves did not appear to be increasing over time. Because attitudes toward wolves are often not strong among the general public, they have the potential to change rapidly if linked to other, stronger attitudes and beliefs. We expect that progress in education and urbanization will lead to increasingly positive attitudes over time. Negative attitudes associated with age are probably a cohort effect, and we should not expect the aging populations in the United States and Europe to lead to more negative wolf attitudes. Paradoxically, successful wolf reintroductions are likely to reduce general positive sentiment, since the presence of wolves gives people a more balanced experience with the animals. Traditionally, people with the most positive attitudes toward wolves have been those with the least experience.",Attitude change; Attitudes; Canis; Education; Reintroduction; Restoration; Wolf,attitudinal survey; canid; carnivore; public attitude; reintroduction; Europe; United States; Canis,2-s2.0-0036074925

First, public opinion surveys reveal the extent of Islamaphobia in Australia and the links between threat perception and constructions of alien-ness and Otherness. The second data set is from a content analysis of the racialized pathologies of Muslims and their spaces.

Negative media treatment is strongly linked to antipathetic government dispositions. This negativity has material impacts upon Australian Muslims.

Reasoning about the evaluation of an opinion is fundamentally different from reasoning about the opinion itself: rather than asking, ""What did Y think of X?"", we are asking, ""What did Z think of Y's opinion of X?"" Here we develop a framework for analyzing and modeling opinion evaluation, using a large-scale collection of Amazon book reviews as a dataset.

As an independent confirmation of the selection bias correction technique, I find that the same methods which predict that opinion polls understate opposition to school integration also predict the results of the 1989 New York City mayoral election more accurately than the marginals of preelection tracking polls.",,,2-s2.0-0033247019

In particular, words or constituents within the expression can interact with each other to yield a particular overall polarity. In this paper, we view such subsentential interactions in light of compositional semantics, and present a novel learning-based approach that incorporates structural inference motivated by compositional semantics into the learning procedure. Our experiments show that (1) simple heuristics based on compositional semantics can perform better than learning-based methods that do not incorporate compositional semantics (accuracy of 89.7% vs. 89.1%), but (2) a method that integrates compositional semantics into learning performs better than all other alternatives (90.7%). We also find that ""content-word negators"", not widely employed in previous work, play an important role in determining expression-level polarity. Finally, in contrast to conventional wisdom, we find that expression-level classification accuracy uniformly decreases as additional, potentially disambiguating, context is considered. © 2008 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,Bag of words; Classification accuracy; Compositional semantics; Learning procedures; Learning-based approach; Learning-based methods; Sentiment analysis; Computational linguistics; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Semantics,2-s2.0-80053377187

In social media, it is easy to amass vast quantities of unlabeled data, but very costly to obtain sentiment labels, which makes unsupervised sentiment analysis essential for various applications. It is challenging for traditional lexicon-based unsupervised methods due to the fact that expressions in social media are unstructured, informal, and fast-evolving. Emoticons and product ratings are examples of emotional signals that are associated with sentiments expressed in posts or words. Inspired by the wide availability of emotional signals in social media, we propose to study the problem of unsupervised sentiment analysis with emotional signals. In particular, we investigate whether the signals can potentially help sentiment analysis by providing a unified way to model two main categories of emotional signals, i.e., emotion indication and emotion correlation. We further incorporate the signals into an unsupervised learning framework for sentiment analysis. In the experiment, we compare the proposed framework with the state-of-the-art methods on two Twitter datasets and empirically evaluate our proposed framework to gain a deep understanding of the effects of emotional signals.

Unfortunately, reading through all customer reviews is difficult, especially for popular items, the number of reviews can be up to hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision. The OpinionMiner system designed in this work aims to mine customer reviews of a product and extract high detailed product entities on which reviewers express their opinions. Opinion expressions are identified and opinion orientations for each recognized product entity are classified as positive or negative. Different from previous approaches that employed rule-based or statistical techniques, we propose a novel machine learning approach built under the framework of lexicalized HMMs. The approach naturally integrates multiple important linguistic features into automatic learning. In this paper, we describe the architecture and main components of the system.

The sentiment features are primarily derived from novel high-coverage tweet-specific sentiment lexicons. These lexicons are automatically generated from tweets with sentiment-word hashtags and from tweets with emoticons. To adequately capture the sentiment of words in negated contexts, a separate sentiment lexicon is generated for negated words.

It shows how nationalism is used to link together key areas of policy-making, including economic policy, national unification and foreign policy. Hughes provides historical context to the debate by examining how nationalism became incorporated into the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party in the 1980s and the ways in which this strengthened and combined with globalization discourse through the domestic crisis of the Tiananmen Massacre and the external shock of the Cold War's conclusion. The different perspectives towards this resulting orthodoxy are discussed, including those of the state and dissent in mainland China and the alternative views from Taiwan and Hong Kong.

Little knowledge is available about how often and why parents refuse immunizations for their children. This study was conducted to estimate, based on reports from health care providers and parents, the frequency of and reasons for immunization refusal. Methods: In 1998, we conducted 32 focus groups of parents and providers in six cities. We then mailed a survey to a random sample of private practice family physicians and pediatricians and public health nurses who immunize children. The overall survey response rate was 77%, and the final sample size was 544. Results: Focus group findings indicated that parents rarely refused vaccines but occasionally resisted specific vaccines. Parents who were unsure about vaccinating were open to discussions about vaccines with a trusted provider. Most of these parents agreed to immunize after discussing concerns with their provider. In a subsequent survey of providers, respondents estimated that they immunized a mean of 3,536 (median 1,560) children annually. The reported mean number of refusals per 1,000 children age <18 years immunized was 7.2 (median 0.4), with varicella vaccine being the most commonly refused. Means did not vary by region or specialty. Providers indicated that fear of side effects heard about from media/word of mouth was the most commonly expressed reason for parents to refuse vaccines (52%). Religious (28%) or philosophical (26%) reasons or belief that the disease was not harmful (26%) were less common reasons. Providers reported that few parents refused because of anti-government sentiment (8%). Conclusions: Providers indicate low vaccine refusal rates within offices of traditional primary care providers and in public health clinics. Strategies for efficient provider-patient communication are needed to address parental concerns about vaccines.",,"chickenpox vaccine; article; childhood disease; demography; doctor patient relation; general practitioner; immunization; nurse; parental behavior; pediatrician; questionnaire; risk benefit analysis; United States; Empirical Approach; Health Care and Public Health; Child, Preschool; Focus Groups; Humans; Immunization; Louisiana; Nurses; Parents; Physician-Patient Relations; Physicians, Family; Treatment Refusal",2-s2.0-2642575191

Attention to both the content and the organizational features of talk suggested that respondents were generally reluctant to be heard to speak about 'this country' in categorical terms, to adopt an explicitly national footing or to display a sense of patriotic national pride. They treated all of these as potentially hearable as symptomatic of 'typical' Anglo-British xenophobia. In contrast to many extant analyses, which suggest that national discourse may provide a legitimate vehicle for the expression of exclusionary or racist sentiments, it appeared that, for these English respondents in this context, talk about 'this country' was often treated as a delicate topic, functionally equivalent to, and subject to the same opprobrium as, talk about 'race'. At the same time, however, various features of the respondents' discourse pointed to the presence of banal (Billig, 1995) national referents.

In this paper, we propose marginalized SDA (mSDA) that addresses two crucial limitations of SDAs: high computational cost and lack of scalability to high-dimensional features. In contrast to SDAs, our approach of mSDA marginalizes noise and thus does not require stochastic gradient descent or other optimization algorithms to learn parameters -in fact, they are computed in closed-form. Consequently, mSDA, which can be implemented in only 20 lines of MATLAB™, significantly speeds up SDAs by two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the representations learnt by mSDA are as effective as the traditional SDAs, attaining almost identical accuracies in benchmark tasks.

What emerges is a more balanced and comprehensive account of gift giving than presently available in the literature of consumer-object relations. Gift giving and receiving engender high levels of anxiety among consumers. Gifts create and exacerbate interpersonal conflict. They are frequently used as weapons, and consumers' responses to them are carefully canalized. The ways in which negativity is managed by donors and recipients are examined. Consumers, victims of sentiment and symbolism, are found to be entrapped in rituals and enjoined by cultural ideology from expressing discontent in most ways except fantasy.

In general, supervised methods consist of two stages: (i) extraction/selection of informative features and (ii) classification of reviews by using learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naïve Bayes (NB). SVM have been extensively and successfully used as a sentiment learning approach while Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have rarely been considered in comparative studies in the sentiment analysis literature. This paper presents an empirical comparison between SVM and ANN regarding document-level sentiment analysis. We discuss requirements, resulting models and contexts in which both approaches achieve better levels of classification accuracy. We adopt a standard evaluation context with popular supervised methods for feature selection and weighting in a traditional bag-of-words model. Except for some unbalanced data contexts, our experiments indicated that ANN produce superior or at least comparable results to SVM's. Specially on the benchmark dataset of Movies reviews, ANN outperformed SVM by a statistically significant difference, even on the context of unbalanced data.

On a global level, it is one of the few cost-effective medical measures that result in universal benefit. Despite this, there is evidence of a growing anti-vaccine movement. In turn, this has, in some cases, resulted in major disruptions in vaccine programs, with resultant needless morbidity and mortality. Of interest are the factors that seem to contribute to the current trend of anti-vaccine sentiment. This paper will examine the current anti-vaccine movement and provide current examples.

In most sentiment analysis applications, the sentiment lexicon plays a central role. However, it is well known that there is no universally optimal sentiment lexicon since the polarity of words is sensitive to the topic domain. Even worse, in the same domain the same word may indicate different polarities with respect to different aspects. For example, in a laptop review, \large"" is negative for the battery aspect while being positive for the screen aspect. In this paper, we focus on the problem of learning a sentiment lexicon that is not only domain specific but also dependent on the aspect in context given an unlabeled opinionated text collection. We propose a novel optimization framework that provides a unified and principled way to combine different sources of information for learning such a context-dependent sentiment lexicon. Experiments on two data sets (hotel reviews and customer feedback surveys on printers) show that our approach can not only identify new sentiment words specific to the given domain but also determine the different polarities of a word depending on the aspect in context. In further quantitative evaluation, our method is proved to be effective in constructing a high quality lexicon by comparing with a human annotated gold standard. In addition, using the learned context-dependent sentiment lexicon improved the accuracy in an aspect-level sentiment classification task.

The aim of this study was to describe tobacco use in a large representative sample of movies. Methods. We analyzed the content of the top 25 box office hits per year from 1988 to 1997. Outcomes included the number of occurrences of tobacco use, the time tobacco use appeared on screen, the context in which tobacco use was portrayed, and characteristics of smokers compared with nonsmokers. Results. Eighty-seven percent of the movies portrayed tobacco use, with a median of 5 occurrences per film. Tobacco use was not related to year of release or box office success of the movie. R-rated movies had the greatest number of occurrences (median = 8.5; P < 0.05) and were most likely to feature major characters using tobacco (81%, P < 0.001). Among major characters, males were more likely to use tobacco than females (28% vs 17%, P < 0.001), but there was no difference in the prevalence of tobacco use by age, race, or socioeconomic status. Tobacco users were typically adults (96.3%) who were more likely to engage in a variety of other risk behaviors. Most tobacco use involved cigarettes or cigars (89.5%). Motivations for on-screen smoking included agitation (20.1%), sadness (5.1%), happiness (15.3%), and relaxation (17.1%). Characters were often shown smoking while confiding in others (30.7%) or in social/celebratory situations (18.0%). Negative reactions to tobacco use were rarely shown (5.9%) and negative consequences resulting from tobacco use were depicted for only 3.4% of the major characters who used tobacco. Conclusion. Despite increasing anti-smoking sentiments in our society, negative reactions to smoking are rare and there is no evidence that tobacco use in movies has declined over the past decade. Movies continue to model smoking as a socially acceptable behavior and portray it as both a way to relieve tension and something to do while socializing. By depicting positive images of tobacco use, movies have the potential to influence adolescent smoking behavior as much as any other environmental exposure, such as family or friend smoking. © 2002 American Health Foundation and Elsevier Science (USA).",,age; agitation; article; audiovisual equipment; behavior; cigarette smoking; controlled study; emotion; human; leisure; priority journal; qualitative analysis; race; sex difference; smoking; social interaction; socioeconomics; tobacco,2-s2.0-0036353563

In this paper we present our machine learning experiments with regard to sentiment analysis in blog, review and forum texts found on the World Wide Web and written in English, Dutch and French. We train from a set of example sentences or statements that are manually annotated as positive, negative or neutral with regard to a certain entity. We are interested in the feelings that people express with regard to certain consumption products. We learn and evaluate several classification models that can be configured in a cascaded pipeline. We have to deal with several problems, being the noisy character of the input texts, the attribution of the sentiment to a particular entity and the small size of the training set. We succeed to identify positive, negative and neutral feelings to the entity under consideration with ca. 83% accuracy for English texts based on unigram features augmented with linguistic features. The accuracy results of processing the Dutch and French texts are ca. 70 and 68% respectively due to the larger variety of the linguistic expressions that more often diverge from standard language, thus demanding more training patterns. In addition, our experiments give us insights into the portability of the learned models across domains and languages.

Consumer-generated product reviews have become a valuable source of information for customers, who read the reviews and decide whether to buy the product based on the information provided. In this paper, we use techniques that decompose the reviews into segments that evaluate the individual characteristics of a product (e.g., image quality and battery life for a digital camera). Then, as a major contribution of this paper, we adapt methods from the econometrics literature, specifically the hedonic regression concept, to estimate: (a) the weight that customers place on each individual product feature, (b) the implicit evaluation score that customers assign to each feature, and (c) how these evaluations affect the revenue for a given product. Towards this goal, we develop a novel hybrid technique combining text mining and econometrics that models consumer product reviews as elements in a tensor product of feature and evaluation spaces. We then impute the quantitative impact of consumer reviews on product demand as a linear functional from this tensor product space. We demonstrate how to use a low-dimension approximation of this functional to significantly reduce the number of model parameters, while still providing good experimental results. We evaluate our technique using a data set from Amazon.com consisting of sales data and the related consumer reviews posted over a 15-month period for 242 products. Our experimental evaluation shows that we can extract actionable business intelligence from the data and better understand the customer preferences and actions. We also show that the textual portion of the reviews can improve product sales prediction compared to a baseline technique that simply relies on numeric data. © 2007 ACM.",Consumer reviews; E-commerce; Econometrics; Electronic commerce; Electronic markets; Hedonic analysis; Internet; Opinion mining; Product review; Sentiment analysis; Text mining; User-generated content,Econometrics; Opinion mining; Product review; Sentiment analysis; Text mining; Data mining; Electronic commerce; Internet; Mathematical models; Text processing; User interfaces; Feature extraction,2-s2.0-36849011074

Weibo, a Twitter-like online social network in China, has attracted more than 300 million users in less than three years, with more than 1000 tweets generated in every second. These tweets not only convey the factual information, but also reflect the emotional states of the authors, which are very important for understanding user behaviors. However, a tweet in Weibo is extremely short and the words it contains evolve extraordinarily fast. Moreover, the Chinese corpus of sentiments is still very small, which prevents the conventional keyword-based methods from being used. In light of this, we build a system called MoodLens, which to our best knowledge is the first system for sentiment analysis of Chinese tweets in Weibo. In MoodLens, 95 emoticons are mapped into four categories of sentiments, i.e. angry, disgusting, joyful, and sad, which serve as the class labels of tweets. We then collect over 3.5 million labeled tweets as the corpus and train a fast Naive Bayes classifier, with an empirical precision of 64.3%. MoodLens also implements an incremental learning method to tackle the problem of the sentiment shift and the generation of new words. Using MoodLens for real-time tweets obtained from Weibo, several interesting temporal and spatial patterns are observed. Also, sentiment variations are well captured by MoodLens to effectively detect abnormal events in China. Finally, by using the highly efficient Naive Bayes classifier, MoodLens is capable of online real-time sentiment monitoring.

The method leverages on lexical resources for sentiment analysis available in English (SentiWordNet). First, a document in a different language than English is translated into English using standard translation software. Then, the translated document is classified according to its sentiment into one of the classes ""positive"" and ""negative"". For sentiment classification, a document is searched for sentiment bearing words like adjectives. By means of SentiWordNet, scores for positivity and negativity are determined for these words. An interpretation of the scores then leads to the document polarity. The method is tested for German movie reviews selected from Amazon and is compared to a statistical polarity classifier based on n-grams. The results show that working with standard technology and existing sentiment analysis approaches is a viable approach to sentiment analysis within a multilingual framework. © 2008 IEEE.",,Classification (of information); Standards; Technology; Data engineering; International conferences; Lexical resources; N-grams; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Standard technology; Translation software; Information retrieval systems,2-s2.0-50249088861

Prior research suggests that the demographic composition and economic conditions of geographic areas influence public support for punitive policies. Yet, these findings rest on assumptions about individual perceptions of minority groups as threatening. This work builds on the threat framework by measuring the concept of ""perceived threat"" and examining the association between aggregate social conditions, perceived threat and punitive sentiments. Analysis of newly collected data suggests that individual perceptions of African Americans as threatening to economic resources is a strong predictor of punitive attitudes. In addition, respondents residing in areas with higher unemployment rates and places that experienced a recent increase in the size of the African American population are more punitive. The latter effect is largely mediated by perceptions of African Americans as threatening to material resources for white respondents. The results agree with racial threat perspectives on social control, but we go beyond extant research by unpacking the micro-level processes that are central to the threat hypothesis. © The University of North Carolina Press.",,,2-s2.0-34247325424

These data have long been assumed to possess face validity and to be the data of choice in any study of the sentiment structure of small scale social systems. However, it is argued that while methods of sociometric analysis have become increasingly more sophisticated they have failed to yield unequivocal results because they do not distinguish structural complexity from measurement error. Through a discussion of increasingly more complex examples the distortion laden character of most sociometric data is illustrated. This distortion is introduced by the formalities of the sociometric test and it will not be removed by developing increasingly more sophisticated structural models or throwing out some of the data. Instead, when issues concerning the nature of specific relational networks are raised data of much higher quality than those which are commonly available are required. A technique for generating high quality sociometric data is briefly discussed. On the other hand, it is suggested that the extant body of sociometric data ought to be adequate when sizeable aggregations are examined for evidence of statistical tendencies in structure. © 1973, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Arguably, one of the most interesting aspects of this trend is the possibility of ""pulsing"" the public's opinion in near real-time and, thus, it has attracted the interest of many researchers as well as news organizations. Recently, it has been reported that predicting electoral outcomes from social media data is feasible, in fact it is quite simple to compute. Positive results have been reported in a few occasions, but without an analysis on what principle enables them. This, however, should be surprising given the significant differences in the demographics between likely voters and users of online social networks. This work aims to test the predictive power of social media metrics against several Senate races of the two recent US Congressional elections. We review the findings of other researchers and we try to duplicate their findings both in terms of data volume and sentiment analysis. Our research aim is to shed light on why predictions of electoral (or other social events) using social media might or might not be feasible. In this paper, we offer two conclusions and a proposal: First, we find that electoral predictions using the published research methods on Twitter data are not better than chance. Second, we reveal some major challenges that limit the predictability of election results through data from social media.

'Energy regions' in Austria are an interesting example for the strategic promotion of such guiding visions in the context of regional development. We describe the case of Murau, an alpine district in which a strong actor network has been built around a vision of systematically exploiting renewable energy sources and at the same time saving the region from economic decay. The vision gained much authority and has been institutionalised at various levels of regional governance. It furthermore was supported by and played an important role for regime level attempts to influence socio-technical change. Development and social propagation of such visions are inherently political and contested processes involving much strategizing and anticipation of conflict. We describe particular discursive strategies applied in niches - such as the combination and translation of sentiments into localised visions and demonstrations of feasibility. These strategies can be understood as systematic attempts to support discursive shifts at regime level by means of local activities, and aim to modify rather durable power structures. We suggest ways to analyse such discursive practices in order to orient strategic action in the course of such processes: analysing 'guiding visions' and their interference with other emerging trends; extending analyses across spatial scales (e.g. translations) and across thematic fields (e.g. convergence of agendas); and focusing on processes of stabilisation, institutionalisation and mutually reinforcing developments. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It is important to identify and filter out the review spam. Previous work only focuses on some heuristic rules, such as helpfulness voting, or rating deviation, which limits the performance of this task. In this paper, we exploit machine learning methods to identify review spam. Toward the end, we manually build a spam collection from our crawled reviews. We first analyze the effect of various features in spam identification. We also observe that the review spammer consistently writes spam. This provides us another view to identify review spam: we can identify if the author of the review is spammer.

Consumers naturally gravitate to reading reviews in order to decide whether to buy a product. However, the high volume of reviews that are typically published for a single product makes it harder for individuals to locate the best reviews and understand the true underlying quality of a product based on the reviews. Similarly, the manufacturer of a product needs to identify the reviews that influence the customer base, and examine the content of these reviews. In this paper, we propose two ranking mechanisms for ranking product reviews: a consumer-oriented ranking mechanism ranks the reviews according to their expected helpfulness, and a manufacturer-oriented ranking mechanism ranks the reviews according to their expected effect on sales. Our ranking mechanism combines econometric analysis with text mining techniques in general, and with subjectivity analysis in particular. We show that subjectivity analysis can give useful clues about the helpfulness of a review and about its impact on sales. Our results can have several implications for the market design of online opinion forums.

We use a novel and large-scale dataset that features daily media content across various conventional media and social media outlets for 824 public traded firms across 6 industries. Social media outlets include blogs, forums, and Twitter. Conventional media includes major newspapers, television broadcasting companies, and business magazines. We apply the advanced sentiment analysis technique that goes beyond the number of mentions (counts) to analyze the overall sentiment of each media resource toward a specific company on the daily basis. We use stock return and risk as the indicators of companies' short-term performances. Our findings suggest that overall social media has a stronger relationship with firm stock performance than conventional media while social and conventional media have a strong interaction effect on stock performance. More interestingly, we find that the impact of different types of social media varies significantly. Different types of social media also interrelate with conventional media to influence stock movement in various directions and degrees. Our study is among the first to examine the effect of multiple sources of social media along with the effect of conventional media and to investigate their relative importance and their interrelatedness.

The existing literature on Twitter sentiment analysis uses various feature sets and methods, many of which are adapted from more traditional text classification problems. In this research, we introduce an approach to supervised feature reduction using n-grams and statistical analysis to develop a Twitter-specific lexicon for sentiment analysis. We augment this reduced Twitter-specific lexicon with brand-specific terms for brand-related tweets. We show that the reduced lexicon set, while significantly smaller (only 187 features), reduces modeling complexity, maintains a high degree of coverage over our Twitter corpus, and yields improved sentiment classification accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the devised Twitter-specific lexicon compared to a traditional sentiment lexicon, we develop comparable sentiment classification models using SVM. We show that the Twitter-specific lexicon is significantly more effective in terms of classification recall and accuracy metrics. We then develop sentiment classification models using the Twitter-specific lexicon and the DAN2 machine learning approach, which has demonstrated success in other text classification problems. We show that DAN2 produces more accurate sentiment classification results than SVM while using the same Twitter-specific lexicon. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Field experiments conducted in 10 naturally ventilated and 26 air-conditioned campus classrooms used survey questionnaires and physical measurements to collect data. A total of 944 individuals in seven universities completed 1294 questionnaires. The chi-square tests were applied to find the significant aspects that affect students' thermal sensations. The results show that air temperature, air movement and mean radiant temperature have significant influence, but humidity has no statistical significance. By using probit regressive analyses, the thermal neutrality and thermal preference of students occurred at 26.3 °C ET * and 24.7 °C ET *, respectively. Responses from those students suggest a wider acceptable temperature range for occupants in Taiwan. The margins of the acceptable zones obtained from direct and indirect acceptability assessing methods are 21.1-29.8 °C ET * and 24.2-29.3 °C ET *, respectively.

Micro-blogging is one of the most popular Web 2.0 applications and related services, like Twitter, have evolved into a practical means for sharing opinions on almost all aspects of everyday life. Consequently, micro-blogging web sites have since become rich data sources for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. Towards this direction, text-based sentiment classifiers often prove inefficient, since tweets typically do not consist of representative and syntactically consistent words, due to the imposed character limit. This paper proposes the deployment of original ontology-based techniques towards a more efficient sentiment analysis of Twitter posts. The novelty of the proposed approach is that posts are not simply characterized by a sentiment score, as is the case with machine learning-based classifiers, but instead receive a sentiment grade for each distinct notion in the post. Overall, our proposed architecture results in a more detailed analysis of post opinions regarding a specific topic. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes a novel probabilistic modeling framework called joint sentiment-topic (JST) model based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which detects sentiment and topic simultaneously from text. A reparameterized version of the JST model called Reverse-JST, obtained by reversing the sequence of sentiment and topic generation in the modeling process, is also studied. Although JST is equivalent to Reverse-JST without a hierarchical prior, extensive experiments show that when sentiment priors are added, JST performs consistently better than Reverse-JST. Besides, unlike supervised approaches to sentiment classification which often fail to produce satisfactory performance when shifting to other domains, the weakly supervised nature of JST makes it highly portable to other domains. This is verified by the experimental results on data sets from five different domains where the JST model even outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches in some of the data sets despite using no labeled documents. Moreover, the topics and topic sentiment detected by JST are indeed coherent and informative. We hypothesize that the JST model can readily meet the demand of large-scale sentiment analysis from the web in an open-ended fashion. © 1989-2012 IEEE.",joint sentiment-topic (JST) model; latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA); opinion mining; Sentiment analysis,Automated tools; Data sets; Different domains; Highly-portable; Labeled documents; Latent dirichlet allocations; Model-based OPC; Modeling process; Opinion mining; Probabilistic modeling; Semi-supervised; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Subjective information; Statistics; Data mining,2-s2.0-84860495542

In this paper, we analyze a set of high- And low-level content-based features on several large collections of Twitter messages. We train a prediction model to forecast for a given tweet its likelihood of being retweeted based on its contents. From the parameters learned by the model we deduce what are the influential content features that contribute to the likelihood of a retweet.

As a result, there can be attempts by firms to manipulate online reviews of products to increase their sales. Despite the suspicion on the existence of such manipulation, the amount of such manipulation is unknown, and deciding which reviews to believe in is largely based on the reader's discretion and intuition. Therefore, the success of the manipulation of reviews by firms in generating sales of products is unknown. In this paper, we propose a simple statistical method to detect online reviews manipulation, and assess how consumers respond to products with manipulated reviews. In particular, the writing style of reviewers is examined, and the effectiveness of manipulation through ratings, sentiments, and readability is investigated. Our analysis examines textual information available in online reviews by combining sentiment mining techniques with readability assessments. We discover that around 10.3% of the products are subject to online reviews manipulation. In spite of the deliberate use of sentiments and ratings in manipulated products, consumers are only able to detect manipulation taking place through ratings, but not through sentiments. The findings from this research ensue a note of caution for all consumers that rely on online reviews of books for making purchases, and encourage them to delve deep into the book reviews without being deceived by fraudulent manipulation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In environments where Latinos are economically advantaged relative to their black neighbors, blacks are more likely to harbor negative stereotypes about Latinos, to be reluctant to extend to Latinos the same policy benefits they themselves enjoy, and to view black and Latino economic and political interests as incompatible.

The globalist hypothesis postulates that a company's CSR efforts are a function of the dictates of the global market place: strong anti-globalization and anti-corporate sentiments generate a need for a positive reputation to obtain a 'social license to operate'. The institutionalist hypothesis postulates that a company's CSR efforts are a function of institutional factors in the national political-economic system: companies based in political-economic systems with strong institutions for social embedding of the economy have comparative institutional advantages for success in CSR. The hypotheses are examined quantitatively by testing an index of national CSR performance against well-established political-economic indicators. The final analysis, based on qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), reveals causal heterogeneity and indicates two separate pathways leading to CSR success. © The Author 2009.

Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we first construct and empirically validate a goldstandard list of lexical features (along with their associated sentiment intensity measures) which are specifically attuned to sentiment in microblog-like contexts. We then combine these lexical features with consideration for five general rules that embody grammatical and syntactical conventions for expressing and emphasizing sentiment intensity. Interestingly, using our parsimonious rule-based model to assess the sentiment of tweets, we find that VADER outperforms individual human raters (F1 Classification Accuracy = 0.96 and 0.84, respectively), and generalizes more favorably across contexts than any of our benchmarks.

Latent Aspect Rating Analysis (LARA) refers to the task of inferring both opinion ratings on topical aspects (e.g., location, service of a hotel) and the relative weights reviewers have placed on each aspect based on review content and the associated overall ratings. A major limitation of previous work on LARA is the assumption of pre-specified aspects by keywords. However, the aspect information is not always available, and it may be difficult to pre-define appropriate aspects without a good knowledge about what aspects are actually commented on in the reviews. In this paper, we propose a unified generative model for LARA, which does not need pre-specified aspect keywords and simultaneously mines 1) latent topical aspects, 2) ratings on each identified aspect, and 3) weights placed on different aspects by a reviewer. Experiment results on two different review data sets demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively perform the Latent Aspect Rating Analysis task without the supervision of aspect keywords. Because of its generality, the proposed model can be applied to explore all kinds of opinionated text data containing overall sentiment judgments and support a wide range of interesting application tasks, such as aspect-based opinion summarization, personalized entity ranking and recommendation, and reviewer behavior analysis.

However, for the same feature, people can express it with many different words or phrases. To produce a useful summary, these words and phrases, which are domain synonyms, need to be grouped under the same feature group. Although several methods have been proposed to extract product features from reviews, limited work has been done on clustering or grouping of synonym features. This paper focuses on this task. Classic methods for solving this problem are based on unsupervised learning using some forms of distributional similarity. However, we found that these methods do not do well. We then model it as a semi-supervised learning problem. Lexical characteristics of the problem are exploited to automatically identify some labeled examples. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

The distillation of knowledge from the huge amount of unstructured information on the Web can be a key factor for tasks such as social media marketing, branding, product positioning, and corporate reputation management. These online social data, however, remain hardly accessible to computers, as they are specifically meant for human consumption. The automatic analysis of online opinions involves a deep understanding of natural language text by machines, from which we are still very far. To this end, concept-level sentiment analysis aims to go beyond a mere word-level analysis of text and provide novel approaches to opinion mining and sentiment analysis that enable a more efficient passage from (unstructured) textual information to (structured) machine-processable data. A recent knowledge-based technology in this context is sentic computing, which relies on the ensemble application of common-sense computing and the psychology of emotions to infer the conceptual and affective information associated with natural language. Sentic computing, however, is limited by the richness of the knowledge base and by the fact that the bag-of-concepts model, despite more sophisticated than bag-of-words, misses out important discourse structure information that is key for properly detecting the polarity conveyed by natural language opinions. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm to concept-level sentiment analysis that merges linguistics, common-sense computing, and machine learning for improving the accuracy of tasks such as polarity detection. By allowing sentiments to flow from concept to concept based on the dependency relation of the input sentence, in particular, we achieve a better understanding of the contextual role of each concept within the sentence and, hence, obtain a polarity detection engine that outperforms state-of-the-art statistical methods. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Objective: To develop a content and sentiment analysis of tobacco-related Twitter posts and build machine learning classifiers to detect tobacco-relevant posts and sentiment towards tobacco, with a particular focus on new and emerging products like hookah and electronic cigarettes. Methods: We collected 7362 tobacco-related Twitter posts at 15-day intervals from December 2011 to July 2012. Each tweet was manually classified using a triaxial scheme, capturing genre, theme, and sentiment. Using the collected data, machine-learning classifiers were trained to detect tobacco-related vs irrelevant tweets as well as positive vs negative sentiment, using Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Finally, phi contingency coefficients were computed between each of the categories to discover emergent patterns. Results: The most prevalent genres were first- and second-hand experience and opinion, and the most frequent themes were hookah, cessation, and pleasure. Sentiment toward tobacco was overall more positive (1939/4215, 46% of tweets) than negative (1349/4215, 32%) or neutral among tweets mentioning it, even excluding the 9% of tweets categorized as marketing. Three separate metrics converged to support an emergent distinction between, on one hand, hookah and electronic cigarettes corresponding to positive sentiment, and on the other hand, traditional tobacco products and more general references corresponding to negative sentiment. These metrics included correlations between categories in the annotation scheme (phihookah-positive=0.39; phie-cigs-positive=0.19); correlations between search keywords and sentiment (χ2 4=414.50, P&lt;.001, Cramer's V=0.36), and the most discriminating unigram features for positive and negative sentiment ranked by log odds ratio in the machine learning component of the study. In the automated classification tasks, SVMs using a relatively small number of unigram features (500) achieved best performance in discriminating tobacco-related from unrelated tweets (F score=0.85). Conclusions: Novel insights available through Twitter for tobacco surveillance are attested through the high prevalence of positive sentiment. This positive sentiment is correlated in complex ways with social image, personal experience, and recently popular products such as hookah and electronic cigarettes. Several apparent perceptual disconnects between these products and their health effects suggest opportunities for tobacco control education. Finally, machine classification of tobacco-related posts shows a promising edge over strictly keyword-based approaches, yielding an improved signal-to-noise ratio in Twitter data and paving the way for automated tobacco surveillance applications.",Natural language processing; Smoking; Social media; Twitter messaging,human; Internet; smoking; tobacco; article; natural language processing; social media; twitter messaging; Humans; Internet; Smoking; Tobacco; natural language processing; smoking; social media; twitter messaging; Humans; Internet; Smoking; Tobacco,2-s2.0-84883360748

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning such features. The central idea is to exploit the existence of landmarks, which are a subset of labeled data instances in the source domain that are distributed most similarly to the target domain. Our approach automatically discovers the landmarks and use them to bridge the source to the target by constructing provably easier auxiliary domain adaptation tasks. The solutions of those auxiliary tasks form the basis to compose invariant features for the original task. We show how this composition can be optimized discriminatively without requiring labels from the target domain. We validate the method on standard benchmark datasets for visual object recognition and sentiment analysis of text. Empirical results show the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art significantly.

Then, we outline an empirical analysis and examine poll results for the 15 U.S. presidential elections between 1944 and 2000. Our analysis focuses specifically on two questions. First, to what extent does the observable variation in aggregate poll results represent real movement in electoral preferences (if the election were held the day of the poll) as opposed to mere survey error? Second, to the extent polls register true movement of preferences owing to the shocks of campaign events, do the effects last or do they decay? Answers to these questions tell us whether and the extent to which campaign events have effects on preferences and, if so, whether these effects persist until Election Day. The answers thus inform us about what we ultimately want to know: Do campaigns have any real impact on the election outcome? The results of our analysis suggest that they do.",,,2-s2.0-0036851467

We have implemented this method in SentBuk, a Facebook application also presented in this paper. SentBuk retrieves messages written by users in Facebook and classifies them according to their polarity, showing the results to the users through an interactive interface. It also supports emotional change detection, friend's emotion finding, user classification according to their messages, and statistics, among others. The classification method implemented in SentBuk follows a hybrid approach: it combines lexical-based and machine-learning techniques. The results obtained through this approach show that it is feasible to perform sentiment analysis in Facebook with high accuracy (83.27%). In the context of e-learning, it is very useful to have information about the users' sentiments available. On one hand, this information can be used by adaptive e-learning systems to support personalized learning, by considering the user's emotional state when recommending him/her the most suitable activities to be tackled at each time. On the other hand, the students' sentiments towards a course can serve as feedback for teachers, especially in the case of online learning, where face-to-face contact is less frequent.

These challenges, along with the interdisciplinary nature of the reconstruction problem, point to the need for greater cooperation between the earth science and statistics communities - a sentiment echoed in recent parliamentary reports. As a step in this direction, it is prudent to formalize what is meant by the paleoclimate reconstruction problem using the language and tools of modern statistics. This article considers the challenge of inferring, with uncertainties, a climate process through space and time from overlapping instrumental and climate sensitive proxy time series that are assumed to be well dated - an assumption that is likely only reasonable for certain proxies over at most the last few millennia. Within a unifying, hierarchical space-time modeling framework for this problem, the modeling assumptions made by a number of published methods can be understood as special cases, and the distinction between modeling assumptions and analysis or inference choices becomes more transparent. The key aims of this article are to 1) establish a unifying modeling and notational framework for the paleoclimate reconstruction problem that is transparent to both the climate science and statistics communities; 2) describe how currently favored methods fit within this framework; 3) outline and distinguish between scientific and statistical challenges; 4) indicate how recent advances in the statistical modeling of large space-time data sets, as well as advances in statistical computation, can be brought to bear upon the problem; 5) offer, in broad strokes, some suggestions for model construction and how to perform the required statistical inference; and 6) identify issues that are important to both the climate science and applied statistics communities, and encourage greater collaboration between the two. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Bayesian methods; Hierarchical modeling; Paleoclimate; Space-time modeling; Spatial modeling,Bayesian methods; Hierarchical modeling; Paleoclimates; Space-time modeling; Spatial modeling; Bayesian networks; Statistical methods; Time series; Concrete beams and girders; Bayesian analysis; data set; hierarchical system; interdisciplinary approach; paleoclimate; proxy climate record; Quaternary; reconstruction; time series; uncertainty analysis,2-s2.0-84862777051

This is leading to a growing sentiment that bypoxic cells may not be a significant limitation to local control of human tumors. To examine whether this is a reasonable conclusion, the relevant in vitro and in vivo data have been summarized so that predictions of the extent of radiosensitization of the hypoxic cells can be made from a knowledge of the clinically achievable levels of MISO. This analysis shows the following: First, the original curve of Adams with V-79 cells is probably over-optimistic in predicting sensitizer enhancement ratios (SERs). A new curve based on the available in vivo data predicts lower sensitization so that even at the highest MISO doses used clinically, SERs for the hypoxic cells to large single X-ray doses of only 1.45 would be expected. In a clinical trial, reoxygenation of the bypoxic cells is likely to occur, thereby considerably reducing the SER for the total tumor cell population. This, together with the problems of heterogeneous tumors and insufficient patient numbers, could well have been responsible for the negative clinical results. Second, even if tumor levels of the new radiosensitizer SR-2508 10 times those of MISO can be achieved clinically, this will still not lead to full radiosensitization of the hypoxic cells (although an SER in excess of 2.0 should be attainable). In conclusion the in vitro and in vivo data with radiosensitizers suggest that only a small effect, if any, is likely to be demonstrated in the clinical trials with MISO, even for those tumors the control of which is limited by hypoxic cells. Thus the question of whether hypoxic cells may or may not limit the local control of tumors by radiotherapy has not been addressed adequately by the presently available radiosensitizing drugs. © 1984.",Clinical trials; Hypoxic cells; Misonidazole; Radiosensitizers; SR-2508,"etanidazole; misonidazole; radiosensitizing agent; 2 nitroimidazolecarboxamide; drug therapy; editorial; human; therapy; Animal; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Dogs; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Evaluation; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Etanidazole; Hamsters; Human; Kinetics; Lethal Dose 50; Mice; Misonidazole; Neoplasms, Experimental; Nitroimidazoles; Radiation-Sensitizing Agents; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",2-s2.0-0021236301

Two schools were characterized by high trust, and high willingness to change; high levels of distrust distinguished three others. This emphasis of the analysis is on the association of spontaneously expressed sentiments of trust or distrust and the association of those sentiments with willingness to participate in change initiated from outside the school building.

Providing support for stronger tobacco control legislation, unfavorable public sentiment has contributed to the decrease in the size of the smoking population in this country. The present study hypothesizes that the unfavorable public sentiment may also discourage cigarette smoking by creating an unfavorable ""smoking climate"" in which smoking is socially rejected as a deviant behavior. Analyses of several secondary data-sets provided evidence that smoking rates are lower in the states where the public holds relatively unfavorable sentiment toward cigarette smoking. The relationship between public sentiment and smoking rates was significant even after controlling for the effects of state-level tobacco control measures, such as cigarette taxes and smoking restrictions in private workplaces and restaurants. We also found that smokers who have experienced unfavorable public sentiment are more willing to quit smoking than those who have not, supporting the hypothesized effects of antismoking public sentiment on smoking behaviors.",,cigarette smoking; health behavior; human; law; review; smoking; tax; tobacco; United States; Health Behavior; Humans; Prejudice; Public Opinion; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Social Conformity; State Government; United States,2-s2.0-2342458954

Such a comparison has not been done before at this scale and is therefore essential for understanding user behavior on microblogging services. In our study, we analyze more than 40 million microblogging activities and investigate microblogging behavior from different angles. We (i) analyze how people access microblogs and (ii) compare the writing style of Sina Weibo and Twitter users by analyzing textual features of microposts. Based on semantics and sentiments that our user modeling framework extracts from English and Chinese posts, we study and compare (iii) the topics and (iv) sentiment polarities of posts on Sina Weibo and Twitter. Furthermore, (v) we investigate the temporal dynamics of the microblogging behavior such as the drift of user interests over time. Our results reveal significant differences in the microblogging behavior on Sina Weibo and Twitter and deliver valuable insights for multilingual and culture-aware user modeling based on microblogging data.

This book revisits the moral and political philosophy of Adam Smith, capitalism’s founding father, to recover his understanding of the morals of the market age. In so doing it illuminates a crucial albeit overlooked side of Smith’s project: his diagnosis of the ethical ills of commercial societies and the remedy he advanced to cure them. Focusing on Smith’s analysis of the psychological and social ills endemic to commercial society – anxiety and restlessness, inauthenticity and mediocrity, alienation and individualism – it argues that Smith sought to combat corruption by cultivating the virtues of prudence, magnanimity, and beneficence. The result constitutes a new morality for modernity, at once a synthesis of commercial, classical, and Christian virtues and a normative response to one of the most pressing political problems of Smith’s day and ours.

The semantic properties we use for exemplifying the approach are positivity and negativity, two properties of central importance in sentiment analysis. The idea derives from the observation that WordNet may be seen as a graph in which synsets are connected through the binary relation ""a term belonging to synset s k occurs in the gloss of synset s i"", and on the hypothesis that this relation may be viewed as a transmitter of such semantic properties. The data for this relation can be obtained from eXtended WordNet, a publicly available sensedisambiguated version of WordNet. We argue that this relation is structurally akin to the relation between hyperlinkedWeb pages, and thus lends itself to PageRank analysis.

Sentiment analysis has been used in several applications including analysis of the repercussions of events in social networks, analysis of opinions about products and services, and simply to better understand aspects of social communication in Online Social Networks (OSNs). There are multiple methods for measuring sentiments, including lexical-based approaches and supervised machine learning methods. Despite the wide use and popularity of some methods, it is unclear which method is better for identifying the polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of a message as the current literature does not provide a method of comparison among existing methods. Such a comparison is crucial for understanding the potential limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of popular methods in analyzing the content of OSNs messages. Our study aims at filling this gap by presenting comparisons of eight popular sentiment analysis methods in terms of coverage (i.e., the fraction of messages whose sentiment is identified) and agreement (i.e., the fraction of identified sentiments that are in tune with ground truth). We develop a new method that combines existing approaches, providing the best coverage results and competitive agreement.

An accurate method for predicting sentiments could enable us, for instance, to extract opinions from the Internet and gauge online customers' preferences, which could prove valuable for economic or marketing research, for leveraging a strategic advantage for an enterprise, or for detecting cyber risk and security threats. In this paper, we propose a heuristic search-enhanced Markov blanket model that is able to capture the dependencies among words and provide a vocabulary that is adequate for the purpose of extracting sentiments. Computational results on two collections of online movie reviews and three collections of online news show that our method is able to identify a parsimonious set of predictive features, yet simultaneously yield comparable or better prediction results about sentiment orientations, than several state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms as well as sentiment prediction methods. Our results suggest that sentiments are captured by conditional dependencies among words as well as by keywords or high-frequency words. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies analyzed this feedback and found that it includes information useful for app developers, such as user requirements, ideas for improvements, user sentiments about specific features, and descriptions of experiences with these features. However, for many apps, the amount of reviews is too large to be processed manually and their quality varies largely. The star ratings are given to the whole app and developers do not have a mean to analyze the feedback for the single features. In this paper we propose an automated approach that helps developers filter, aggregate, and analyze user reviews. We use natural language processing techniques to identify fine-grained app features in the reviews. We then extract the user sentiments about the identified features and give them a general score across all reviews. Finally, we use topic modeling techniques to group fine-grained features into more meaningful high-level features. We evaluated our approach with 7 apps from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and compared its results with a manually, peer-conducted analysis of the reviews. On average, our approach has a precision of 0.59 and a recall of 0.51. The extracted features were coherent and relevant to requirements evolution tasks. Our approach can help app developers to systematically analyze user opinions about single features and filter irrelevant reviews. © 2014 IEEE.",,Stars; Automated approach; Fine grained; High-level features; NAtural language processing; Requirements evolution; Sentiment analysis; Topic Modeling; User requirements; Natural language processing systems,2-s2.0-84909943417

However, the influx of online consumer reviews has caused information overload, making it difficult for consumers to choose reliable reviews. For an online retail market to succeed, it is important to lead product reviewers to write more helpful reviews, and for consumers to get helpful reviews more easily by figuring out the factors determining the helpfulness of online reviews. For this research, 75,226 online consumer reviews were collected from Amazon.com using a Web data crawler. Additional information on review content was also gathered by carrying out a sentiment analysis for mining review text. Our results show that both peripheral cues, including review rating and reviewer's credibility, and central cues, such as the content of reviews, influence the helpfulness of reviews. Based on dual process theories, we find that consumers focus on different information sources of reviews, depending on their purposes for reading reviews: online reviews can be used for information search or for evaluating alternatives.

One condition presented an obesity curriculum on the controllable reasons for obesity (i.e., diet/exercise). A prejudice reduction condition presented evidence on the uncontrollable reasons for obesity (i.e., genes/environment); whereas a neutral (control) curriculum focused on alcohol use in young people. Measures of implicit and explicit anti-fat prejudice, beliefs about obese people, and dieting, were taken at baseline and postintervention. Repeated measures analyses showed decreases in two forms of implicit anti-fat prejudice (decreases of 27 and 12%) in the genes/environment condition relative to other conditions. The diet/exercise condition showed a 27% increase in one measure of implicit anti-fat prejudice. Reductions in explicit anti-fat prejudice were also seen in the genes/environment condition (P = 0.006). No significant changes in beliefs about obese people or dieting control beliefs were found across conditions.

For Be18 and PWM4, these are the first chemical abundance measurements. Combining our data with literature results produces a compilation of some 68 chemical abundance measurements in 49 unique clusters. For this combined sample, we study the chemical abundances of open clusters as a function of distance, age, and metallicity. We confirm that the metallicity gradient in the outer disk is flatter than the gradient in the vicinity of the solar neighborhood. We also confirm that the open clusters in the outer disk are metal-poor with enhancements in the ratios [α/Fe] and perhaps [Eu/Fe]. All elements show negligible or small trends between [X/Fe] and distance (&lt;0.02dexkpc -1), but for some elements, there is a hint that the local (R GC&lt; 13kpc) and distant (R GC&gt; 13kpc) samples may have different trends with distance. There is no evidence for significant abundance trends versus age (&lt;0.04dex Gyr -1). We measure the linear relation between [X/Fe] and metallicity, [Fe/H], and find that the scatter about the mean trend is comparable to the measurement uncertainties. Comparison with solar neighborhood field giants shows that the open clusters share similar abundance ratios [X/Fe] at a given metallicity. While the flattening of the metallicity gradient and enhanced [α/Fe] ratios in the outer disk suggest a chemical enrichment history different from that of the solar neighborhood, we echo the sentiments expressed by Friel etal. that definitive conclusions await homogeneous analyses of larger samples of stars in larger numbers of clusters.

As with face-to-face meetings, Internet exchanges may not only include factual information but also emotional information - how participants feel about the subject discussed or other group members. Emotions in turn are known to be important in affecting interaction partners in offline communication in many ways. Could emotions in Internet exchanges affect others and systematically influence quantitative and qualitative aspects of the trajectory of e-communities? The development of automatic sentiment analysis has made large scale emotion detection and analysis possible using text messages collected from the web. However, it is not clear if emotions in e-communities primarily derive from individual group members' personalities or if they result from intra-group interactions, and whether they influence group activities. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, for the first time, we show the collective character of affective phenomena on a large scale as observed in four million posts downloaded from Blogs, Digg and BBC forums. To test whether the emotions of a community member may influence the emotions of others, posts were grouped into clusters of messages with similar emotional valences. The frequency of long clusters was much higher than it would be if emotions occurred at random. Distributions for cluster lengths can be explained by preferential processes because conditional probabilities for consecutive messages grow as a power law with cluster length. For BBC forum threads, average discussion lengths were higher for larger values of absolute average emotional valence in the first ten comments and the average amount of emotion in messages fell during discussions. Conclusions/Significance: Overall, our results prove that collective emotional states can be created and modulated via Internet communication and that emotional expressiveness is the fuel that sustains some e-communities. © 2011 Chmiel et al.",,affect; article; community; controlled study; emotionality; Internet; social interaction; cluster analysis; cooperation; data base; demography; emotion; time; Cluster Analysis; Cooperative Behavior; Databases as Topic; Emotions; Internet; Residence Characteristics; Time Factors,2-s2.0-79960798429

In contrast to most studies that focus on determining only sentiment orientation (positive versus negative), the proposed method performs fine-grained analysis to determine both the sentiment orientation and sentiment strength of the reviewer towards various aspects of a movie. Sentences in review documents contain independent clauses that express different sentiments toward different aspects of a movie. The method adopts a linguistic approach of computing the sentiment of a clause from the prior sentiment scores assigned to individual words, taking into consideration the grammatical dependency structure of the clause. The prior sentiment scores of about 32,000 individual words are derived from SentiWordNet with the help of a subjectivity lexicon. Negation is delicately handled.

In the present paper we apply a method recently proposed by other social scientists to three different scenarios, by analyzing on one side the online popularity of Italian political leaders throughout 2011, and on the other the voting intention of French Internet users in both the 2012 presidential ballot and the subsequent legislative election. While Internet users are not necessarily representative of the whole population of a country's citizens, our analysis shows a remarkable ability for social media to forecast electoral results, as well as a noteworthy correlation between social media and the results of traditional mass surveys. We also illustrate that the predictive ability of social media analysis strengthens as the number of citizens expressing their opinion online increases, provided that the citizens act consistently on these opinions. © The Author(s) 2013.",Analysis of public opinion; electoral campaign; political forecast; sentiment analysis; social media; text analytics; text mining,,2-s2.0-84894238224

The temporal overlap of growing immigration to the South since the late 1990s and growing nativist sentiment across the US since 9/11 has led southern communities to fuse new regional racial demographics to new national border anxieties. This convergence enables southern political elites to address the changing contours of local communities through recourse to national imperatives of border security, all the while avoiding an explicit language of race in a thoroughly racialized debate. In an analysis of recent political maneuvers in the South, this article examines what happens when debates about nation, community, and borders are relocated to southern spaces heretofore absent in discussions of immigration. It argues that legislative actions against immigrant populations in southern states are virulent and multi-scalar border policings in which concerns about the social and cultural boundaries of southern communities, new racial projects across the South, and post-9/11 immigrant anxieties across the US become inseparable. To conclude, it discusses the theoretical insight that this critical assessment of the South's new border projects offers vis-à-vis understandings of, and struggles against, exclusion, racism, and social injustice. © 2007 The Author Journal compilation © 2007 Editorial Board of Antipode.",9/11; Immigration; Political geographies; Scale; The border; US South,immigrant population; immigration; national security; political border; political integration; regional politics; social justice; terrorism; North America; United States,2-s2.0-36849007316

If campaigns are associated with reduced smoking, such cuts could result in long-term increases in state health care costs. Methods: Commercial ratings data on mean audience exposure to antitobacco advertising that appeared on network and cable television across the largest 75 media markets in the United States for 1999 through 2000 were combined with nationally representative survey data from school-based samples of youth in the contiguous 48 states. Multivariate regression models were used to analyze associations between mean exposure to state antitobacco advertising and youth smoking-related beliefs and behaviors, controlling for individual and environmental factors usually associated with youth smoking and other televised tobacco-related advertising. Results: Mean exposure to at least 1 state-sponsored antitobacco advertisement in the past 4 months was associated with lower perceived rates of friends' smoking (odds ratio [OR], 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.88), greater perceived harm of smoking (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.11-1.42), stronger intentions not to smoke in the future (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.17-1.74), and lower odds of being a smoker (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.63-0.88). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the potential impact of state-sponsored antitobacco media campaigns while controlling for other tobacco-related advertising and other tobacco control policies. State-sponsored antitobacco advertising is associated with desired outcomes of greater antitobacco sentiment and reduced smoking among youth. Recent cuts in these campaigns may have future negative health and budgetary consequences. ©2005 American Medical Association.

In this paper, we propose WisCom, a system that can analyze tens of mil- lions user ratings and comments in mobile app markets at three different levels of detail. Our system is able to (a) discover inconsistencies in reviews; (b) identify reasons why users like or dislike a given app, and provide an interactive, zoomable view of how users' reviews evolve over time; and (c) provide valuable insights into the entire app market, identifying users' major concerns and preferences of different types of apps. Results using our techniques are reported on a 32GB dataset consisting of over 13 million user reviews of 171,493 Android apps in the Google Play Store.

Nearly 2.5 million posts from over 18 thousand users were investigated. Scale-free distributions were observed for activity in individual discussion threads as well as for overall activity. The number of unique users in a thread normalized by the thread length decays with thread length, suggesting that thread life is sustained by mutual discussions rather than by independent comments. Automatic sentiment analysis shows that most posts contain negative emotions and the most active users in individual threads express predominantly negative sentiments. It follows that the average emotion of longer threads is more negative and that threads can be sustained by negative comments. An agent-based computer simulation model has been used to reproduce several essential characteristics of the analyzed system.

This review offers an introduction to the problems that face researchers and developers of IR systems in microblog settings. After an overview of microblogs and the behavior surrounding them, the review describes established problems in microblog retrieval, such as entity search and sentiment analysis, and modeling abstractions, such as authority and quality.

We observed increased activation in the insula, supplementary motor area, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), and temporal parietal junction when participants were behaving consistent with our model, and found increased activity in the ventromedial PFC, dorsomedial PFC, and nucleus accumbens when they chose to abuse trust and maximize their financial reward.

The multi-methodological analyses reveal how the construct of gastronationalism can help us better understand pan-national tensions in symbolic boundary politics-politics that protect certain foods and industries as representative of national cultural traditions. I first analyze the macro-level dimensions of market protections by examining the European Union's program for origin-designation labels that delineates particular foods as nationally owned. The micro-level, empirical case-the politics surrounding foie gras in France-demonstrates how gastronationalism functions as a protectionist mechanism within lived experience. Foie gras is an especially relevant case because other parties within the pan-national system consider it morally objectionable.

This book demonstrates that, beginning with the election of Ronald Reagan as president in 1980, US politicians have employed religion as a partisan weapon, using it in a no-holds-barred calculus designed to attract voters, identify enemies, and solidify power. The book reveals this political approach by identifying four crucial religious signals used by leading Republicans and Democrats, from Reagan to Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to the front-running candidates for the 2008 presidential election. In their emphasis on God and faith in public addresses, commemorations of tragedies and requests for divine blessing for the nation, the issue agendas pursued, and even the audiences addressed and the nature of Christmas celebrations, today's political leaders use religion for partisan gain in a manner distinct from those who came before. These signals become apparent through analysis of thousands of public communications by American politicians over the past seventy-five years, the tracking of public sentiment on several topics during the same period, and the perspectives of interest groups and political strategists. The result of these developments is an environment in the United States in which religion and politics have become almost inseparably intertwined - an outcome which benefits savvy politicians but endangers the vitality of church, state, and the entire American experiment in democracy. © 2008 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

Despite such promising market sentiment, the battery system management remains as a challenging issue to be resolved in order to provide a safe and reliable power and energy storage system. Here we report advancement in the battery management approach by providing a solution to analyze battery performance variations in a lot of batteries produced from the same manufacturing process. A lot of 100 Li-ion cells were analyzed in order to quantify the inherent cell variations associated with cell manufacturing process and test protocol. Both statistical and electrochemical analyses were used to characterize and quantify the capacity variations among the cells along with other parameters that can be readily derived from the test results. Information extracted from a minimal testing of the cells in the lot and more intensive characterizations on a few cells including one as the nominal sample cell allows the establishment of a single cell model (SCM), based on a generic equivalent circuit, with high accuracy in predicting cell performance. The analyses also permit a carefully crafted logic development of how to separate the origins that cause the cell variations in performance. Such separation of the attributes enable a proper tuning of the cell parameters in the model, which allows the accommodation of cell variations in a battery pack model to handle most of the imbalance issues. A careful validation of the SCM to predict performance of any arbitrary cell in the lot with high accuracy was demonstrated. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Battery pack; Battery pack management; Equivalent circuit model; Intrinsic cell imbalance; Statistical analysis,Battery pack; Equivalent circuit model; Intrinsic cell imbalance; Statistical analysis; Cells; Circuit theory; Cytology; Electronics industry; Energy storage; Flywheels; Industrial engineering; Lithium batteries; Power electronics; Production engineering; Renewable energy resources; Statistical methods; Bioinformatics,2-s2.0-75849150576

Furthermore, our approach performs sentiment analysis for both Chinese reviews and English reviews, and then uses ensemble methods to combine the individual analysis results. Experimental results on a dataset of 886 Chinese product reviews demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The individual analysis of the translated English reviews outperforms the individual analysis of the original Chinese reviews, and the combination of the individual analysis results further improves the performance. © 2008 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,Analysis results; Data sets; Ensemble methods; Ensemble techniques; Machine translations; Product reviews; Sentiment analysis; Computational linguistics; Data mining; Knowledge management; Learning algorithms; Translation (languages); Natural language processing systems,2-s2.0-80053343577

Outbursts of anti-immigrant sentiment among political leaders and in the broader public are fueled by a debate over who is worthy of being considered for full incorporation into the nation, and who is incapable of assimilating and taking on the characteristics and responsibilities associated with being an American. In Illegal, Alien, or Immigrant, Lina Newton carefully dissects the political debates over contemporary immigration reform. Beginning with a close look at the disputes of the 1980s and 1990s, she reveals how a shift in legislator's portrayals of illegal immigrants-from positive to overwhelmingly negative-facilitated the introduction and passing of controversial reforms. Newton's analysis reveals how rival descriptions of immigrant groups and the flattering or disparaging myths that surround them define, shape, and can ultimately determine fights over immigration policy. Her pathbreaking findings will shed new light on the current political battles, their likely outcomes, and where to go from here. © 2008 by New York University.

He finds that people give many reasons for their opposition to new houses; some are related to their effects on people next door.

Most of these researchers are unaware of the original effort to investigate these patterns of cognitive error and, consequently, misunderstand, as did the original investigators, some of the implications of their own work. The discovery of this important social phenomenon by Floyd H. Allport and his students, Daniel Katz and Richard L. Schanck, and how their preoccupation with individual characteristics and their relative neglect of social characteristics led them to underestimate the value of their discovery, is discussed. Allport's original interest in pluralistic ignorance and how he and Katz documented it empirically are presented, as is a review of Schanck's research extending their analysis.

We aimed to develop a new application of existing surveillance systems to detect and characterise early signs of vaccine issues. We also aimed to develop a typology of concerns and a way to assess the priority of each concern. Methods: Following preliminary research by The Vaccine Confidence Project, media reports (eg, online articles, blogs, government reports) were obtained using the HealthMap automated data collection system, adapted to monitor online reports about vaccines, vaccination programmes, and vaccine-preventable diseases. Any reports that did not meet the inclusion criteria-any reference to a human vaccine or vaccination campaign or programme that was accessible online-were removed from analysis. Reports were manually analysed for content and categorised by concerns, vaccine, disease, location, and source of report, and overall positive or negative sentiment towards vaccines. They were then given a priority level depending on the seriousness of the reported event and time of event occurrence. We used descriptive statistics to analyse the data collected during a period of 1 year, after refinements to the search terms and processes had been made. Findings: We analysed data from 10380 reports (from 144 countries) obtained between May 1, 2011, and April 30, 2012. 7171 (69%) contained positive or neutral content and 3209 (31%) contained negative content. Of the negative reports, 1977 (24%) were associated with impacts on vaccine programmes and disease outbreaks; 1726 (21%) with beliefs, awareness, and perceptions; 1371 (16%) with vaccine safety; and 1336 (16%) with vaccine delivery programmes. We were able to disaggregate the data by country and vaccine type, and monitor evolution of events over time and location in specific regions where vaccine concerns were high. Interpretation: Real-time monitoring and analysis of vaccine concerns over time and location could help immunisation programmes to tailor more effective and timely strategies to address specific public concerns.

This has lead to the emergence of a new data-driven research field: mathematical methods of computer science, statistical physics and sociometry provide insights on a wide range of disciplines ranging from social science to human mobility. A recent important discovery is that search engine traffic (i.e., the number of requests submitted by users to search engines on the www) can be used to track and, in some cases, to anticipate the dynamics of social phenomena. Successful examples include unemployment levels, car and home sales, and epidemics spreading. Few recent works applied this approach to stock prices and market sentiment. However, it remains unclear if trends in financial markets can be anticipated by the collective wisdom of on-line users on the web. Here we show that daily trading volumes of stocks traded in NASDAQ-100 are correlated with daily volumes of queries related to the same stocks. In particular, query volumes anticipate in many cases peaks of trading by one day or more. Our analysis is carried out on a unique dataset of queries, submitted to an important web search engine, which enable us to investigate also the user behavior. We show that the query volume dynamics emerges from the collective but seemingly uncoordinated activity of many users. These findings contribute to the debate on the identification of early warnings of financial systemic risk, based on the activity of users of the www. © 2012 Bordino et al.",,article; computer interface; financial information system; financial management; marketing; search engine; web browser; Internet; Investments; Search Engine,2-s2.0-84864135851

From the extant literature, we demarcate the following three competing theories of public punitiveness: the escalating crime-distrust model, the moral decline model, and the racial animus model. Controlling for other known predictors of crime-related opinions, we test the explanatory power of these perspectives to account for support for the death penalty and for a punitive crime-control approach. Our analysis of a national sample of respondents surveyed in the 2000 National Election Study reveals partial support for each model. Racial animus, however, seems to exert the most consistent effect on public sentiments. This finding suggests that racial resentments are inextricably entwined in public punitiveness and thus should be incorporated into any complete theory of this phenomenon. © 2010 American Society of Criminology.",Crime-control policy; Public opinion; Racial animus; Theories of punitiveness,,2-s2.0-77950272316

There are a large number of factors mediating suicide. Many studies have searched for a direct causal relationship between economic hardship and suicide, however, findings have been varied. Method. Suicide data was obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the period between January 1968 and August 2002. These were correlated with a suite of macroeconomic data including housing loan interest rates, unemployment rates, days lost to industrial disputes, Consumer Price Index, gross domestic product, and the Consumer Sentiment Index. Results. A total of 51845 males and 16327 females committed suicide between these dates. There were significant associations between suicide rates and eleven macroeconomic indicators for both genders in at least one age range. Data was divided into male and female and five age ranges and pooled ages. Analyses were conducted on these 132 datasets resulting in 80 significant findings. The data was generally stronger for indices measuring economic performance than indices measuring consumers' perceptions of the state of the economy. A striking difference between male and female trends was seen. Generally, male suicide rates increased with markers of economic adversity, while the opposite pattern was seen in females. There were significantly different patterns in age-stratified data, with for example higher housing loan interest rates having a positive association with suicide in younger people and a negative association in older age groups. Conclusion. Macroeconomic trends are significantly associated with suicide. The patterns in males and females are very different, and there are further substantial age-related differences. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.",,adolescent; adult; age; aged; article; Australia; child; consumer attitude; controlled study; correlation analysis; data analysis; economic aspect; female; housing; human; infant; information processing; major clinical study; male; sex difference; socioeconomics; suicide; unemployment; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Australia; Child; Cluster Analysis; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Suicide; Time Factors; Unemployment,2-s2.0-31144456979

As people interweave thoughts and feelings across spheres of life, over time, economic and noneconomic logics become blurred, leading to multiple, often conflicting sentiments. Cognitive dissonance is not necessarily resolved and manifests in incoherent consumer practices. Understanding individuals' often covert disarticulation from communities can help proactively uncover avenues for expressing agency within structures of constraint. The geographies of multiple logics also clarify behavior in production regarding thoughts and feelings emanating from outside the workplace. Managers can use this knowledge to achieve competitiveness by accommodating workers' needs and nurturing collaboration, tapping overlapping social networks across time and space. Thinking normatively about the spatiality of emotions requires analytical fluidity to relate context-specific and mobile, mutable processes.

TS helps users manage the vast amount of information available, by condensing documents' content and extracting the most relevant facts or topics included in them. The rapid development of emerging technologies poses new challenges to this research field, which still need to be solved. Therefore, it is essential to analyse its progress over the years, and provide an overview of the past, present and future directions, highlighting the main advances achieved and outlining remaining limitations. With this purpose, several important aspects are addressed within the scope of this survey. On the one hand, the paper aims at giving a general perspective on the state-of-the-art, describing the main concepts, as well as different summarisation approaches, and relevant international forums. Furthermore, it is important to stress upon the fact that the birth of new requirements and scenarios has led to new types of summaries with specific purposes (e.g. sentiment-based summaries), and novel domains within which TS has proven to be also suitable for (e.g. blogs). In addition, TS is successfully combined with a number of intelligent systems based on HLT (e.g. information retrieval, question answering, and text classification). On the other hand, a deep study of the evaluation of summaries is also conducted in this paper, where the existing methodologies and systems are explained, as well as new research that has emerged concerning the automatic evaluation of summaries' quality. Finally, some thoughts about TS in general and its future will encourage the reader to think of novel approaches, applications and lines to conduct research in the next years.

Our modeling approach captures two key features of our data, dynamics and endogeneity. In terms of dynamics, we model daily measures of online communications about a firm and its products as contributing to a latent demand-generating stock variable. To account for the endogeneity, we extend the latent instrumental variable technique to account for dynamic endogenous regressors. Our results demonstrate a significant effect of positive, negative, and neutral online communications on daily sales performance.

However, public attitudes cited in theories as a critical linchpin of professional status remain relatively unexplored in the face of these changes and widespread contentions of public dissatisfaction. Using data from the 1976 National Survey of Access to Care (Aday, Andersen, and Fleming 1980) and the 1998 General Social Survey (Davis, Smith, and Mardsen 1998), we take advantage of a unique opportunity to compare the public's attitudes across a 20-year period. We examine individuals' evaluations of the way physicians do their work and their ability to confront health problems. Three findings support a complex view of public sentiments. First, while public confidence in physicians remains relatively high, we document a crystallization of attitudes reflecting greater negative and fewer positive sentiments. Second, while neither the structure of attitudes nor the role of sociodemographic characteristics in explaining attitudes has significantly shifted over time, in 1998 health status and insurance status are correlated with negative attitudes. Third, using General Social Survey time trend data on the confidence in medicine compared to other professions (science and education), we find support for a general public response to social institutions, with confidence in medicine tracking closely with confidence in science in level, and education in pattern. We end with four possible explanations of our findings, including and a general discussion of the role of the public in the professional status of physicians and its implications for social change in the institution of medicine.",,"article; factorial analysis; health care policy; health insurance; health status; human; multivariate analysis; physician; public opinion; United States; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Health Care Reform; Health Status; Humans; Insurance, Health; Multivariate Analysis; Physicians; Public Opinion; United States",2-s2.0-0035287215

The roles played by five explanatory factors are examined in the operations in Kuwait, Northern Iraq, Somalia, Rwanda and Haiti. These factors are: a clear humanitarian and/or legal case, national interest, chance of success, domestic support and the CNN effect. Two distinct patterns leading to enforcement operations are identified: one driven by national interest, the other by humanitarian sentiment. A clear case for intervention (unambiguous interstate aggression or massive human suffering) is necessary for UN Security Council authorization, but the ensuing pattern depends on whether national interests are perceived to be at stake. Governments will work hard to mobilize support and accept a significant number of casualties when national interest is at stake. Humanitarian interventions, on the contrary, are driven by a combination of the CNN effect and good chances of success, as governments are reluctant to take casualties when national interests are not involved. The analysis concludes that UN enforcement operations will be the exception to the rule in the foreseeable future, and questions the conventional assumptions that broad domestic support and national interest are necessary conditions for enforcement operations as well as the widespread belief that the CNN effect drives humanitarian interventions.",,,2-s2.0-0030529744

Recent studies suggest that ensemble learning methods may have potential applicability in sentiment classification. In this study, we conduct a comparative assessment of the performance of three popular ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting, and Random Subspace) based on five base learners (Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine) for sentiment classification. Moreover, ten public sentiment analysis datasets were investigated to verify the effectiveness of ensemble learning for sentiment analysis. Based on a total of 1200 comparative group experiments, empirical results reveal that ensemble methods substantially improve the performance of individual base learners for sentiment classification. Among the three ensemble methods, Random Subspace has the better comparative results, although it was seldom discussed in the literature.

Typically, sentiment classification has been modeled as the problem of training a binary classifier using reviews annotated for positive or negative sentiment. However, sentiment is expressed differently in different domains, and annotating corpora for every possible domain of interest is costly. Applying a sentiment classifier trained using labeled data for a particular domain to classify sentiment of user reviews on a different domain often results in poor performance because words that occur in the train (source) domain might not appear in the test (target) domain. We propose a method to overcome this problem in cross-domain sentiment classification. First, we create a sentiment sensitive distributional thesaurus using labeled data for the source domains and unlabeled data for both source and target domains. Sentiment sensitivity is achieved in the thesaurus by incorporating document level sentiment labels in the context vectors used as the basis for measuring the distributional similarity between words. Next, we use the created thesaurus to expand feature vectors during train and test times in a binary classifier. The proposed method significantly outperforms numerous baselines and returns results that are comparable with previously proposed cross-domain sentiment classification methods on a benchmark data set containing Amazon user reviews for different types of products. We conduct an extensive empirical analysis of the proposed method on single- and multisource domain adaptation, unsupervised and supervised domain adaptation, and numerous similarity measures for creating the sentiment sensitive thesaurus. Moreover, our comparisons against the SentiWordNet, a lexical resource for word polarity, show that the created sentiment-sensitive thesaurus accurately captures words that express similar sentiments. © 2013 IEEE.",Cross-domain sentiment classification; Domain adaptation; Thesauri creation,Automatic classification; Binary classifiers; Contextual advertisings; Distributional similarities; Domain adaptation; Negative sentiments; Sentiment classification; Similarity measure; Classification (of information); Text processing; Thesauri,2-s2.0-84897584660

The aim is to determine whether opinions expressed on different topics in a conditional sentence are positive, negative or neutral. Conditional sentences are one of the commonly used language constructs in text. In a typical document, there are around 8% of such sentences. Due to the condition clause, sentiments expressed in a conditional sentence can be hard to determine. For example, in the sentence, if your Nokia phone is not good, buy this great Samsung phone, the author is positive about ""Samsung phone"" but does not express an opinion on ""Nokia phone"" (although the owner of the ""Nokia phone"" may be negative about it). However, if the sentence does not have ""if"", the first clause is clearly negative. Although ""if"" commonly signifies a conditional sentence, there are many other words and constructs that can express conditions. This paper first presents a linguistic analysis of such sentences, and then builds some supervised learning models to determine if sentiments expressed on different topics in a conditional sentence are positive, negative or neutral. Experimental results on conditional sentences from 5 diverse domains are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2009 ACL and AFNLP.",,Diverse domains; Language constructs; Linguistic analysis; Samsung; Sentiment analysis; Computational linguistics; Data mining; Telephone sets; Natural language processing systems,2-s2.0-80053417584

The book begins with a basic overview of cross-cultural measurement of sentiments and presents innovative and sophisticated analyses of measurement issues and of homogeneity among respondents. Subsequent chapters explore topics that are at the core of successful data collection and analysis in culture studies, including: The role of bipolar scales and Internet data collection in measuring sentiments. Key methodological variables that determine the quality of quantitative data, including measurement errors, validity, and reliability. New approaches to reliability and several new methods of assessing a respondent's degree of inculcation into group culture. Sampling, coverage, nonresponse, and measurement errors, with an in-depth discussion of their occurrence in culture surveys, their impact assessments, and how current measurement techniques are constructed to help prevent these kinds of errors. Common problems often encountered in the acquisition and communication of data, including identifying error variances, interpreting gender differences in responses, and defining the difference between cultures and subcultures. Throughout the book, each topic is accompanied by a review of related methodological literature. For many of the presented concepts, the author includes a formal analysis of the related issues in measuring cultural norms and reports on analyses. Each chapter concludes with an organized list of major findings as well as an insightful outline of specific recommendations regarding practical problems in culture studies.

One of the key issues is how to combine a document's opinionate score (the ranking score of to what extent it is subjective or objective) and topic relevance score. Current solutions to document ranking in opinion retrieval are generally ad-hoc linear combination, which is short of theoretical foundation and careful analysis. In this paper, we focus on lexicon-based opinion retrieval. A novel generation model that unifies topic-relevance and opinion generation by a quadratic combination is proposed in this paper. With this model, the relevance-based ranking serves as the weighting factor of the lexicon-based sentiment ranking function, which is essentially different from the popular heuristic linear combination approaches. The effect of different sentiment dictionaries is also discussed. Experimental results on TREC blog datasets show the significant effectiveness of the proposed unified model. Improvements of 28.1% and 40.3% have been obtained in terms of MAP and p@10 respectively. The conclusion is not limited to blog environment. Besides the unified generation model, another contribution is that our work demonstrates that in the opinion retrieval task, a Bayesian approach to combining multiple ranking functions is superior to using a linear combination. It is also applicable to other result re-ranking applications in similar scenario.

Sentiment analysis over Twitter offers organisations a fast and effective way to monitor the publics' feelings towards their brand, business, directors, etc. A wide range of features and methods for training sentiment classifiers for Twitter datasets have been researched in recent years with varying results. The primary issues in previous techniques are classification accuracy, data sparsity and sarcasm, as they incorrectly classify most of the tweets with a very high percentage of tweets incorrectly classified as neutral. This research paper focuses on these problems and presents an algorithm for twitter feeds classification based on a hybrid approach. The proposed method includes various pre-processing steps before feeding the text to the classifier.

Even though facts still play a very important role when information is sought on a topic, opinions have become increasingly important as well. Opinions expressed in blogs and social networks are playing an important role influencing everything from the products people buy to the presidential candidate they support. Thus, there is a need for a new type of search engine which will not only retrieve facts, but will also enable the retrieval of opinions. Such a search engine can be used in a number of diverse applications like product reviews to aggregating opinions on a political candidate or issue. Enterprises can also use such an engine to determine how users perceive their products and how they stand with respect to competition. This paper presents an algorithm which not only analyzes the overall sentiment of a document/review, but also identifies the semantic orientation of specific components of the review that lead to a particular sentiment.

Therefore, this thesis proposes a new senti-lexicon for the sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews. When classifying a review document as a positive sentiment and as a negative sentiment using the supervised learning algorithm, there is a tendency for the positive classification accuracy to appear up to approximately 10% higher than the negative classification accuracy. This creates a problem of decreasing the average accuracy when the accuracies of the two classes are expressed as an average value. In order to mitigate such problem, an improved Naïve Bayes algorithm is proposed. The result of the experiment showed that when this algorithm was used and a unigrams + bigrams was used as the feature, the gap between the positive accuracy and the negative accuracy was narrowed to 3.6% compared to when the original Naïve Bayes was used, and that the 28.5% gap was able to be narrowed compared to when SVM was used. Additionally, the use of this algorithm based on the senti-lexicon showed an accuracy that improved by a maximum of 10.2% in recall and a maximum of 26.2% in precision compared to when SVM was used, and by a maximum of 5.6% in recall and a maximum of 1.9% in precision compared to when Naïve Bayes was used. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A number of approaches have been proposed for creating such lexicons, but they tend to be computationally expensive, and usually rely on significant manual annotation and large corpora. Most of these methods use WordNet. In contrast, we propose a simple approach to generate a high-coverage semantic orientation lexicon, which includes both individual words and multi-word expressions, using only a Roget-like thesaurus and a handful of affixes. Further, the lexicon has properties that support the Polyanna Hypothesis. Using the General Inquirer as gold standard, we show that our lexicon has 14 percentage points more correct entries than the leading WordNet-based high-coverage lexicon (SentiWordNet). In an extrinsic evaluation, we obtain significantly higher performance in determining phrase polarity using our thesaurus-based lexicon than with any other. Additionally, we explore the use of visualization techniques to gain insight into the our algorithm beyond the evaluations mentioned above. © 2009 ACL and AFNLP.",,Gain insight; Gold standards; Manual annotation; Multi-word; Percentage points; Semantic orientation; Sentiment analysis; Simple approach; Visualization technique; Wordnet; Computational linguistics; Ontology; Semantics; Thesauri; Visualization; Natural language processing systems,2-s2.0-78651462430

Design: Descriptive qualitative synthesis of sociocultural studies in 4 countries using iterative theme-based analyses. Setting: Four developing countries: India, Peru, Uganda, and Vietnam. Participants: Criterion-based sample of 252 focus group discussions and 470 in-depth interviews with children, parents, teachers/administrators, health workers/ managers, and community/religious leaders. A knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey was administered to 879 children and 875 parents in Vietnam. Results: We found that vaccine decision-making was primarily done by parents, with children having some role. Understanding of cervical cancer and HPV was limited; however, the gravity of cancer and some symptoms of cervical cancer were recognized. Vaccination and government-sponsored immunization programs were generally supported by respondents. Sentiments toward cervical cancer vaccines were positive, but concerns about quality of delivery, safety, adverse effects, and the effect on fertility were raised. Communities requested comprehensive awareness-raising and health education to address these concerns. Conclusion: Sociocultural studies help elucidate the complexities of introducing a new vaccine from the perspective of children, parents, and communities. Strategies for introducing the HPV vaccine should address community concerns through effective communication, appropriate delivery, and targeted advocacy to make the program locally relevant. ©2009 American Medical Association.

To describe naturally occurring care relationships between unpaid, nonprofessional, nonkin (unrelated) caregivers and frail community-living older adults. Methods. Face-to-face, semistructured interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of 114 caregivers and care recipients recruited from the community through a variety of organizations. Standard techniques for thematic analysis of qualitative data were used along with descriptive and other statistics as appropriate for numerate data. Results. Nonkin caregiving proved to be heterogeneous in initiation of relationship, form, duration, tasks performed, and association with family caregivers. Partnerships ranged from 0.1 to 57 years in duration, with just over half (58%) starting with the provision of care. Many caregivers (47%) were themselves older adults, aged 65 or older. There was little variation in what motivated or rewarded caregivers, many of whom felt morally obligated to help. More than half the sample used kin terms to characterize their relationship. Four distinct styles of relationship were discerned, varying by degree of emotional intimacy and types of assistance given. All relationships, however, involved socializing and help with at least two instrumental tasks of daily life. Discussion. This kind of caregiving is important for sustaining community living for about 10% of frail elderly persons. A greater understanding is needed, from both theoretical and practical perspectives, of when and how nonkin relationships are beneficial and why they in many ways successfully mirror the actions and sentiments of family caregivers.",,"adult; aged; article; caregiver; community; daily life activity; elderly care; emotion; female; human; male; priority journal; socialization; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Caregivers; Family Relations; Female; Frail Elderly; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Middle Aged; Social Support",2-s2.0-0036239442

Most of the proposed solutions are centered around supervised, machine learning approaches and review-oriented datasets. In this article, we focus on the more common informal textual communication on the Web, such as online discussions, tweets and social network comments and propose an intuitive, less domain-specific, unsupervised, lexicon-based approach that estimates the level of emotional intensity contained in text in order to make a prediction. Our approach can be applied to, and is tested in, two different but complementary contexts: subjectivity detection and polarity classification. Extensive experiments were carried on three real-world datasets, extracted from online social Web sites and annotated by human evaluators, against state-of-the-art supervised approaches. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm, even though unsupervised, outperforms machine learning solutions in the majority of cases, overall presenting a very robust and reliable solution for sentiment analysis of informal communication on theWeb. © 2012 ACM.",Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Social media,Data sets; Domain specific; Informal communication; Learning approach; Online discussions; Opinion mining; Polarity classification; Real-world datasets; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Social Networks; Communication; Data mining; Learning systems; Social networking (online),2-s2.0-84867420933

By sentiment analysis, we refer to the problem of assigning a quantitative positive/negative mood to a short bit of text. Most studies in this area are limited to the identification of sentiments and do not investigate the interplay between sentiments and other factors. In this work, we use a sentiment extraction tool to investigate the influence of factors such as gender, age, education level, the topic at hand, or even the time of the day on sentiments in the context of a large online question answering site. We start our analysis by looking at direct correlations, e.g., we observe more positive sentiments on weekends, very neutral ones in the Science & Mathematics topic, a trend for younger people to express stronger sentiments, or people in military bases to ask the most neutral questions. We then extend this basic analysis by investigating how properties of the (asker, answerer) pair affect the sentiment present in the answer. Among other things, we observe a dependence on the pairing of some inferred attributes estimated by a user's ZIP code. We also show that the best answers differ in their sentiments from other answers, e.g., in the Business & Finance topic, best answers tend to have a more neutral sentiment than other answers. Finally, we report results for the task of predicting the attitude that a question will provoke in answers. We believe that understanding factors influencing the mood of users is not only interesting from a sociological point of view, but also has applications in advertising, recommendation, and search.

Analyzing the large volume of online reviews available would produce useful actionable knowledge that could be of economic values to vendors and other interested parties. In this paper, we conduct a case study in the movie domain, and tackle the problem of mining reviews for predicting product sales performance. Our analysis shows that both the sentiments expressed in the reviews and the quality of the reviews have a significant impact on the future sales performance of products in question. For the sentiment factor, we propose Sentiment PLSA (S-PLSA), in which a review is considered as a document generated by a number of hidden sentiment factors, in order to capture the complex nature of sentiments. Training an S-PLSA model enables us to obtain a succinct summary of the sentiment information embedded in the reviews. Based on S-PLSFA, we propose ARSA, an Autoregressive Sentiment-Aware model for sales prediction. We then seek to further improve the accuracy of prediction by considering the quality factor, with a focus on predicting the quality of a review in the absence of user-supplied indicators, and present ARSQA, an Autoregressive Sentiment and Quality Aware model, to utilize sentiments and quality for predicting product sales performance. Extensive experiments conducted on a large movie data set confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2012 IEEE.",prediction; Review mining; sentiment analysis,Auto-regressive; Complex nature; Data sets; Economic values; Product sales; Quality factors; Sales performance; sentiment analysis; Significant impacts; Motion pictures; Sales; Forecasting,2-s2.0-84863236785

Based on observations of Twitter's role in civilian response during the recent 2009 Jakarta and Mumbai terrorist attacks, we propose a structured framework to harvest civilian sentiment and response on Twitter during terrorism scenarios. Coupled with intelligent data mining, visualization, and filtering methods, this data can be collated into a knowledge base that would be of great utility to decision-makers and the authorities for rapid response and monitoring during such scenarios. Using synthetic experimental data, we demonstrated that the proposed framework has yielded meaningful graphical visualizations of information, to reveal potential response to terrorist threats. The novelty of this study is that microblogging has never been studied in the domain of terrorism informatics.

In particular, the assigned identities recall notions of how good, how powerful, and how lively each person is fundamentally. When events deflect feelings away from these sentiments, new events are conceived and ordinarily implemented to move feelings back toward the fundamental values. Thus, theoretically, social behavior and transient feelings form a control system with fundamental sentiments as reference signals. Interpersonal conflicts sometimes lead to events that a person cannot comprehend as sentiment confirming. This invokes redefinitions of situations, a higher order control that changes reference signals. Empirically derived formulas describing affective reactions to events have been elaborated into a mathematical model representing all of these processes. Data on a large number of social identities and behaviors have been collected to permit simulations using the model. Illustrations show that this theory of social action permits concrete, plausible analyses of social interactions, role relationships, and social reactions to deviance. Simulations of group dynamics in organizational contexts conceivably could provide guidelines for changing group functioning and for establishing social structures without historical precedent.

For sentence labeling, we propose a weakly-supervised approach that utilizes only minimal prior knowledge-in the form of seed words-to enforce a direct correspondence between topics and aspects. This correspondence is used to label sentences with performance that approaches a fully supervised baseline. For multi-aspect rating prediction, we find that overall ratings can be used in conjunction with our sentence labelings to achieve reasonable performance compared to a fully supervised baseline. When gold-standard aspect-ratings are available, we find that topic model based features can be used to improve unsophisticated supervised baseline performance, in agreement with previous multi-aspect rating prediction work. This improvement is diminished, however, when topic model features are paired with a more competitive supervised baseline-a finding not acknowledged in previous work. © 2011 IEEE.",Multi-aspect sentiment analysis; Topic modeling,Base-line performance; Labelings; Multiaspect; Sentiment analysis; Topic model; Forecasting; Rating; Data mining,2-s2.0-84857180506

However, the latent features make it difficulty to explain the recommendation results to the users. Fortunately, with the continuous growth of online user reviews, the information available for training a recommender system is no longer limited to just numerical star ratings or user/item features. By extracting explicit user opinions about various aspects of a product from the reviews, it is possible to learn more details about what aspects a user cares, which further sheds light on the possibility to make explainable recommendations. In this work, we propose the Explicit Factor Model (EFM) to generate explainable recommendations, meanwhile keep a high prediction accuracy. We first extract explicit product features (i.e. aspects) and user opinions by phrase-level sentiment analysis on user reviews, then generate both recommendations and disrecommendations according to the specific product features to the user's interests and the hidden features learned. Besides, intuitional feature-level explanations about why an item is or is not recommended are generated from the model. Offline experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of our framework over competitive baseline algorithms on both rating prediction and top-K recommendation tasks. Online experiments show that the detailed explanations make the recommendations and disrecommendations more inuential on user's purchasing behavior Copyright 2014 ACM.",Collaborative Filtering; Recommendation explanation; Recommender systems; Sentiment analysis,Algorithms; Collaborative filtering; Data mining; Forecasting; Recommender systems; Latent factor models; On-line experiments; Prediction accuracy; Purchasing behaviors; Recommendation algorithms; Recommendation explanation; Sentiment analysis; Top-K recommendations; Behavioral research,2-s2.0-84904544672

A sample of 319 South African and 822 Finnish primary and secondary education teachers completed a questionnaire containing a scale measuring sentiments, attitudes and concerns on inclusive education as well as a scale measuring teachers' self-efficacy in implementing inclusive practices. A comparative analysis indicated that whereas the overall sentiments towards disabilities were positive in both countries, teachers had many concerns about the consequences of including children with disabilities in their classrooms. While the most positive aspect of self-efficacy among the South African teachers was their self-efficacy in managing behaviour, the Finnish teachers saw this as their weakest point. Self-efficacy, in particular efficacy in collaboration, was clearly related to overall attitudes towards inclusion.

Researchers, however, have only recently begun to move beyond considerations of how fundamentalist Christian affiliations might shape preferences for punitive correctional policies. The present study broadens the extant research by examining multiple aspects of religious beliefs and how they affect support for capital punishment and harsher local courts. Analyses of General Social Survey data show that religion has divergent effects. Beyond a mere fundamentalist or conservative religious view, those who have a rigid and moralistic approach to religion and who imagine God as a dispassionate, powerful figure who dispenses justice are more likely to harbor punitive sentiments toward offenders. In contrast, those who have a gracious or loving image of God and who are compassionate toward others - that is, those who take seriously the admonition to ""turn the other cheek"" - are less supportive of ""get tough"" policies. In the end, not only is religion a multi-dimensional phenomenon but also its features likely coalesce to divide believers into opposite camps-with one set of attributes fostering harsh sentiments toward offenders and another set of attributes tempering punitiveness and justifying interventions aimed at helping the criminally wayward. © 2005 Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.",Capital punishment; Christian fundamentalism; Public opinion; Punitive ideology; Religion,,2-s2.0-27844435681

Although accumulating evidence links internalized homophobia and sexual risk behavior, no study has explored the impact of internalized homophobia on efforts to prevent these behaviors. This paper examines the effect of internalized homophobia on gay and bisexual men's awareness of participation in, and perceptions of programs offered by a community-based HIV prevention organization. In Study 1, 595 gay and bisexual men reported their levels of awareness of and participation in HIV prevention programming offered by one community organization. Internalized homophobia was negatively related to men's awareness of the services offered by the organization. However, among the men who were aware of at least one service, internalized homophobia did not further predict service utilization. Study 2 examined 89 gay and bisexual men who participated for a single session in a group-structured, community-based HIV preventive intervention. Pre- to immediate postintervention change in perceptions of condom use self-efficacy was inversely related to internalized homophobia. Internalized homophobia was also a significant negative predictor of the extent to which participants felt similar to and related well with other members of the group. Together, these findings suggest that internalized homophobia may pose multiple barriers to community-based HIV prevention efforts. © 2002 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",Bisexual men; Gay men; HIV prevention; Internalized homophobia; Service utilization,adult; article; bisexuality; financial management; homosexuality; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; male; middle aged; multivariate analysis; patient attitude; preventive health service; psychological aspect; regression analysis; safe sex; self concept; social psychology; United States; utilization review; Adult; Arizona; Bisexuality; HIV Infections; Homosexuality; Humans; Male; Marketing of Health Services; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Prejudice; Preventive Health Services; Regression Analysis; Safe Sex; Self Concept,2-s2.0-0036617646

To monitor developments in opinions about Muslims and Arabs (both living in the United States and abroad) and attitudes toward the Islamic faith, survey organizations began to assess more regularly Americans' attitudes on these topics. I analyze developments in public sentiment about Arab and Muslim Americans and Islam in the age of the war on terror using available public opinion data. The data analyses in this study suggest that Americans possess lingering resentment and reservations about Arab and Muslim Americans. The evidence also reveals low levels of awareness about basic elements of Islam but growing anxiety about Islam's (especially Islamic fundamentalism's) compatibility with Western values of tolerance, acceptance, and civility. Some of the sharpest movement in opinion dynamics we observe is in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, but opinion levels stabilize shortly thereafter.

Religious denominations have been deeply involved on both sides of the issue, drawing both on teachings and traditions of justice and on those that emphasize the dignity of human life. Scholarly researchers have investigated the role that religious beliefs play in shaping sentiments toward crime control policies, with a particular focus on the relationship between belonging to a Christian fundamentalist denomination and support for the death penalty. Researchers have reasoned that Christian fundamentalists should be more likely to support capital punishment than other more moderate denominations because they hold conservative religious beliefs that justify the use of the death penalty. Using 1998 data from the General Social Survey, the authors initially show that contrary to common views, Christian fundamentalist affiliation is unrelated to support for capital punishment. Subsequent analyses reveal, however, that this null relationship is not straightforward but complex: fundamentalists embrace certain religious beliefs and involvement that both increase and decrease punitiveness. The study thus suggests that understanding the impact of religion on crime control attitudes potentially requires disentangling countervailing effects of different features of religiosity. © 2006 Sage Publications.",Christian fundamentalism; Death penalty; Punitiveness,article; christian; controlled study; female; health care policy; history; human; major clinical study; male; morality; punishment; religion; social aspect,2-s2.0-33645462442

In this paper we analyze how Dengue epidemic is reflected on Twitter and to what extent that information can be used for the sake of surveillance. Dengue is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that is a leading cause of illness and death in tropical and subtropical regions, including Brazil. We propose an active surveillance methodology that is based on four dimensions: volume, location, time and public perception. First we explore the public perception dimension by performing sentiment analysis. This analysis enables us to filter out content that is not relevant for the sake of Dengue surveillance. Then, we verify the high correlation between the number of cases reported by official statistics and the number of tweets posted during the same time period (i.e., R2 = 0:9578). A clustering approach was used in order to exploit the spatiotemporal dimension, and the quality of the clusters obtained becomes evident when they are compared to official data (i.e., RandIndex = 0:8914). As an application, we propose a Dengue surveillance system that shows the evolution of the dengue situation reported in tweets, which is implemented in www.observatorio.inweb. org.br/dengue/.

This semi-supervised approach to domain adaptation is extremely simple to implement and can be applied as a pre-processing step to any supervised learner. Our theoretical analysis (in terms of Rademacher complexity) of EA and EA++ show that the hypothesis class of EA++ has lower complexity (compared to EA) and hence results in tighter generalization bounds.

Design.-A cross-sectional household survey of the parents of inner-city Latino children. Setting.-South Central and East Los Angeles, Calif, 1992. Population.-Children 12 to 36 months old and their parents from 817 Latino families. Main Outcome Variables.-Continuous Medicaid enrollment, continuity of care, deferral of care, and number of visits. Methods.-Univariate analysis, logistic and linear regression by demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, residency status, and language use. Results.-Children were primarily born in the United States (96%), but most parents were not citizens (80%). Only 40.0% of eligible children had continuous Medicaid coverage since birth, 18.6% had never been insured, and 20.7% had received episodic Medicaid coverage. Continuous Medicaid coverage was negatively associated with either the caregiver (odds ratio [OR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19-0.56) or their partner (OR = 0.33, 95% CI=0.20-0.55) working. Residency status, language preference, and length of US residency were not associated with continuous Medicaid enrollment. Insurance coverage was associated with more physician visits, greater continuity of care, and fewer deferrals of care. Conclusion.-While most (84%) young Latino children in inner-city Los Angeles were eligible for Medicaid, a substantial proportion (39.3%) have episodic or no coverage. Insurance status and provider type were more consistently associated with access rather than residency and language preference. In the aftermath of California's Proposition 187 and federal welfare reform, insurance status and ac are likely to worsen for these young children unless the wave of anti- immigration sentiments is held in check.",,"article; child; child health care; ethnic group; health care access; health care utilization; health insurance; health maintenance organization; human; immigrant; major clinical study; medicaid; minority group; priority journal; united states; urban population; Aliens; California; Clinical Approach/Source; Empirical Approach; Federal Government; Health Care and Public Health; Indigents; Los Angeles; Medicaid; Professional Patient Relationship; Social Discrimination; Survey; United States; Child; Child Health Services; Continuity of Patient Care; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emigration and Immigration; Federal Government; Health Services Accessibility; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Infant; Insurance, Health; Likelihood Functions; Los Angeles; Medicaid; Multivariate Analysis; Regression Analysis; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; Urban Population",2-s2.0-0031029224

For instance, on IMDb users leave reviews, commenting on different aspects of a movie (e.g. actors, plot, visual effects), and expressing their sentiments (positive or negative) on these aspects in their reviews. This suggests that uncovering aspects and sentiments will allow us to gain a better understanding of users, movies, and the process involved in generating ratings. The ability to answer questions such as ""Does this user care more about the plot or about the special effects?"" or ""What is the quality of the movie in terms of acting?"" helps us to understand why certain ratings are generated. This can be used to provide more meaningful recommendations. In this work we propose a probabilistic model based on collaborative filtering and topic modeling. It allows us to capture the interest distribution of users and the content distribution for movies; it provides a link between interest and relevance on a per-aspect basis and it allows us to differentiate between positive and negative sentiments on a per-aspect basis. Unlike prior work our approach is entirely unsupervised and does not require knowledge of the aspect specific ratings or genres for inference. We evaluate our model on a live copy crawled from IMDb.

In such an environment, the ability to automatically analyze user opinions and sentiments as discussions develop is a powerful resource known as real time sentiment analysis. However, this task comes with several challenges, including the need to deal with highly dynamic textual content that is characterized by changes in vocabulary and its subjective meaning and the lack of labeled data needed to support supervised classifiers. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning strategy to perform real time sentiment analysis. We identify a task - opinion holder bias prediction - which is strongly related to the sentiment analysis task; however, in constrast to sentiment analysis, it builds accurate models since the underlying relational data follows a stationary distribution. Instead of learning textual models to predict content polarity (i.e., the traditional sentiment analysis approach), we first measure the bias of social media users toward a topic, by solving a relational learning task over a network of users connected by endorsements (e.g., retweets in Twitter). We then analyze sentiments by transferring user biases to textual features. This approach works because while new terms may arise and old terms may change their meaning, user bias tends to be more consistent over time as a basic property of human behavior. Thus, we adopted user bias as the basis for building accurate classification models. We applied our model to posts collected from Twitter on two topics: the 2010 Brazilian Presidential Elections and the 2010 season of Brazilian Soccer League. Our results show that knowing the bias of only 10% of users generates an F1 accuracy level ranging from 80% to 90% in predicting user sentiment in tweets.

Most prior work either use prior lexical knowledge defined as sentiment polarity of words or view the task as a text classification problem and rely on labeled corpora to train a sentiment classifier. While lexicon-based approaches do not adapt well to different domains, corpus-based approaches require expensive manual annotation effort. In this paper, we propose a novel framework where an initial classifier is learned by incorporating prior information extracted from an existing sentiment lexicon with preferences on expectations of sentiment labels of those lexicon words being expressed using generalized expectation criteria. Documents classified with high confidence are then used as pseudo-labeled examples for automatical domain-specific feature acquisition. The word-class distributions of such self-learned features are estimated from the pseudo-labeled examples and are used to train another classifier by constraining the model's predictions on unlabeled instances.

The purpose of this study was to analyse effects of ecotourism on natural resource use and livelihoods in an indigenous community of 80 families in Peru. Household interviews and participant observation were used to track social and economic changes in the community as it partnered with a private tour company to build and co-manage an ecotourism lodge. Effects of ecotourism were measured among the same households before and after the lodge opened, and between households with varying levels of participation. The hypothesis that economic benefits from ecotourism. would provide incentives for people to alter their livelihoods and change their uses of natural resources was tested. Results showed that ecotourism effects were ambiguous. Though employment led to a general decline in farming and hunting, new income enabled greater market consumption and expansion of production. Ecotourism also prompted sentiments not easily measured in economic analyses alone, including willingness to be involved in ecotourism work, despite relatively minimal economic returns. These findings are a reflection of the fact that ecotourism is not merely an economic 'tool' for conservation, but also the cause of new values and social relations. © 2007 A.

Social media, including Twitter, has been one method used by the Society to accomplish this goal. Twitter is a popular microblogging service that serves as a potent tool for disseminating information. It allows for short messages (140 characters) to be composed by any author and distributes those messages globally and quickly. The dissemination of information is necessary if Twitter is to be considered a tool that can increase public awareness of kidney disease. We hypothesized that content, citation, and sentiment analyses of tweets generated from Kidney Week 2011 would reveal a large number of educational tweets that were disseminated to the public. An ideal tweet for accomplishing this goal would include three key features: 1) informative content, 2) internal citations, and 3) positive sentiment score. Informative content was found in 29% of messages, greater than that found in a similarly sized medical conference (2011 ADA Conference, 16%). Informative tweets were more likely to be internally, rather than externally, cited (38% versus 22%, p<0.0001), thereby amplifying the original information to an even larger audience. Informative tweets had more negative sentiment scores than uninformative tweets (means -0.162 versus 0.199 respectively, p<0.0001), therefore amplifying a tweet whose content had a negative tone. Our investigation highlights significant areas of promise and improvement in using Twitter to disseminate medical information in nephrology from a scientific conference. This goal is pertinent to many nephrology-focused conferences that wish to increase public awareness of kidney disease. © 2012 Desai et al.",,article; awareness; citation analysis; content analysis; health education; human; information dissemination; information processing; kidney disease; medical information; medical society; nephrology; social media; United States; Blogging; Congresses as Topic; Humans; Information Dissemination; Kidney; Kidney Diseases; Nephrology; Social Media,2-s2.0-84863621350

This article fills this gap through an analysis of large samples of text comments on YouTube videos. The results identify patterns and give some benchmarks against which future YouTube research into individual videos can be compared. For instance, the typical YouTube comment was mildly positive, was posted by a 29-year-old male, and contained 58 characters. About 23% of comments in the complete comment sets were replies to previous comments. There was no typical density of discussion on YouTube videos in the sense of the proportion of replies to other comments: videos with both few and many replies were common. The YouTube audience engaged with each other disproportionately when making negative comments, however; positive comments elicited few replies. The biggest trigger of discussion seemed to be religion, whereas the videos attracting the least discussion were predominantly from the Music, Comedy, and How to & Style categories.

There are also many companies offering opinion mining services. One problem that has not been studied so far is the assignment of entities that have been talked about in each sentence. Let us use forum discussions about products as an example to make the problem concrete. In a typical discussion post, the author may give opinions on multiple products and also compare them. The issue is how to detect what products have been talked about in each sentence. If the sentence contains the product names, they need to be identified. We call this problem entity discovery. If the product names are not explicitly mentioned in the sentence but are implied due to the use of pronouns and language conventions, we need to infer the products. We call this problem entity assignment. These problems are important because without knowing what products each sentence talks about the opinion mined from the sentence is of little use. In this paper, we study these problems and propose two effective methods to solve the problems. Entity discovery is based on pattern discovery and entity assignment is based on mining of comparative sentences. Experimental results using a large number of forum posts demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique. Our system has also been successfully tested in a commercial setting.

In this work, to measure the strength and polarity of an opinion, we consider the economic context in which the opinion is evaluated, instead of using human annotators or linguistic resources. We rely on the fact that text in on-line systems influences the behavior of humans and this effect can be observed using some easy-to-measure economic variables, such as revenues or product prices. By reversing the logic, we infer the semantic orientation and strength of an opinion by tracing the changes in the associated economic variable. In effect, we use econometrics to identify the ""economic value of text"" and assign a ""dollar value"" to each opinion phrase, measuring sentiment effectively and without the need for manual labeling. We argue that by interpreting opinions using econometrics, we have the first objective, quantifiable, and contextsensitive evaluation of opinions.

Design/methodology/approach - The study establishes a conceptual framework for examining photography based on La chambre claire's contrast of rational codes (Studium) with intuitive elements (Punctum). An application of the framework is provided in considering the heterogeneity and accountability of NGOs through an examination of the Oxfam Annual Review 2003/2004 front cover photograph. Findings - The framework is enlightening: the photograph's Studium reflects the complexity of Oxfam's dual engagement in the corporate and charitable sectors, and the developed and developing worlds; its Punctum arouses sentiment and compassion. Research limitations/implications - The study provides a model which may be applied to the wealth of photographs produced by contemporary organizations; the framework encompasses promotional images as well as photographic art, and is well suited to figurative photography. It is limited regarding photographs of a hybrid or abstract nature. Practical implications - The analysis is of interest to accounting researchers, practitioners, trainees, auditors and any user of accounting and accountability statements. It illuminates the way in which photographs highlight, complement and supplement information more traditionally communicated in numbers and words. Originality/value - The paper adds to research into NGOs; augments theoretical work on photographs in accountability literature; and expands the empirical literature on the interpretation of photographs in accounting and accountability statements. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Annual reports; Communication; Non-governmental organizations; Photographs,,2-s2.0-33847358725

The narratives situate their various articulations of Islamic womanhood in ways that both affirm and challenge traditional religious notions. At the same time they also are subject to Orientalist1 representations of veiled and burqa clad women that represent them as oppressed and backward.

The study tests these tivo explanations using public-opinion surveys on opposition to immigration in France, Germany, and the USA and polls on support for the French Front national, the German Republikaner, and California's Proposition 187. Multivariate analysis weakly supports economic self-interest but generally confirms the cultural if not economic form of marginality.

The fractions derived from these two methods of separation were characterized and compared in order to determine the most complete and discriminating compositional analysis for subsequent use in studies concerning the stability of emulsions or sludges which are produced by these crudes in refinery processing. The resin and asphaltene fractions are of primary interest due to their polar, surface-active nature, the central role these fractions play in stabilizing emulsions and sludges, and their resulting influence on crude processability. Preparatory-scale separations were developed and utilized to provide sufficient amounts of the polar fractions of these crudes for further studies. The H/C ratio and concentrations of S, N, and O as well as V and Ni contents were determined for each of the crudes and their respective fractions. The results of this investigation also provided useful information regarding the H-bonding capacity (as gauged by the functional group types and content) and aromaticity of the polar fractions of these particular crude oils. The polar functional groups and carbon types were identified and quantitated by FTIR and 13C NMR spectroscopy. FTIR analysis also provided an indirect measure of the polarity of substituent groups attached to the aromatic core of these molecules when comparing the results of the integration of the aromatic C=C stretch with the aromaticity as measured by 13C NMR analysis. Both the H-bonding capacity and the aromaticity are considered to play a central role in determining the solubility of asphaltenes in the crude medium which in turn has a significant effect on the emulsifying potential of the crude oil. In the comparison of the two fractionation methods, the resin and total asphaltene yields were very similar for most of the crude types; however, the characteristics of these polar fractions varied considerably in all the crudes depending upon the method used to isolate them. There was strong evidence to support the prevailing sentiment that the fraction which is coined ""asphaltenes"" is greatly influenced and defined by the very method utilized to isolate this fraction. When considering and analyzing the characteristics of the polar materials in their totality (i.e., resins + asphaltenes), these materials were very similar in nature regardless of the fractionation method used to isolate them. However, irreversible adsorption of asphaltenic components (up to ∼0.8 wt % of whole crude) on the silica gel does occur when employing the extrographic technique. Thus, the ppt + ext fractionation method appears to be the simplest and most robust method to provide further understanding of the mechanisms which govern the stability of emulsions produced from different crude types.",,,2-s2.0-0000799990

We propose two sentiment topic models to associate latent topics with evoked emotions of readers. The first model which is an extension of the existing Supervised Topic Model, generates a set of topics from words firstly, followed by sampling emotions from each topic. The second model generates topics from social emotions directly. Both models can be applied to social emotion classification and generate social emotion lexicons. Evaluation on social emotion classification verifies the effectiveness of the proposed models. The generated social emotion lexicon samples further show that our models can discover meaningful latent topics exhibiting emotion focus. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.",Sentiment topic model; Social emotion classification; Social emotion lexicon; Social emotion mining,,2-s2.0-84894107278

In LBSNs, users can check in and leave tips commenting on a venue. These two heterogeneous data sources both describe users' preference of venues. However, in current research work, only users' check-in behavior is considered in users' location preference model, users' tips on venues are seldom investigated yet. Moreover, while existing work mainly considers social influence in recommendation, we argue that considering venue similarity can further improve the recommendation performance. In this research, we ameliorate location recommendation by enhancing not only the user location preference model but also recommendation algorithm. First, we propose a hybrid user location preference model by combining the preference extracted from check-ins and text-based tips which are processed using sentiment analysis techniques. Second, we develop a location based social matrix factorization algorithm that takes both user social influence and venue similarity influence into account in location recommendation. Using two datasets extracted from the location based social networks Foursquare, experiment results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid preference model can better characterize user preference by maintaining the preference consistency, and the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

This growing interest in measuring sentiment coincides with a dramatic increase in the volume of digitized information. Computer automation has a great deal of potential in this new media environment. The objective here is to outline and validate a new automated measurement instrument for sentiment analysis in political texts. Our instrument uses a dictionary-based approach consisting of a simple word count of the frequency of keywords in a text from a predefined dictionary. The design of the freely available Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary (LSD) is discussed in detail here. The dictionary is tested against a body of human-coded news content, and the resulting codes are also compared to results from nine existing content-analytic dictionaries. Analyses suggest that the LSD produces results that are more systematically related to human coding than are results based on the other available dictionaries. The LSD is thus a useful starting point for a revived discussion about dictionary construction and validation in sentiment analysis for political communication. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",content analysis; media tone; methodology,,2-s2.0-84860811138

This paper studies aspect-based opinion polling from unlabeled free-form textual customer reviews without requiring customers to answer any questions. First, a multi-aspect bootstrapping method is proposed to learn aspect-related terms of each aspect that are used for aspect identification. Second, an aspect-based segmentation model is proposed to segment a multi-aspect sentence into multiple single-aspect units as basic units for opinion polling. Finally, an aspect-based opinion polling algorithm is presented in detail. Experiments on real Chinese restaurant reviews demonstrated that our approach can achieve 75.5 percent accuracy in aspect-based opinion polling tasks. The proposed opinion polling method does not require labeled training data. It is thus easy to implement and can be applicable to other languages (e.g., English) or other domains such as product or movie reviews. © 2011 IEEE.",aspect-based analysis; opinion mining; Opinion polling; sentiment analysis,aspect-based analysis; Bootstrapping method; Customer review; Labeled training data; Opinion mining; Opinion polling; Sentiment analysis; Sales; Customer satisfaction,2-s2.0-84857915039

This study measures the prevalence and predictors of mental health distress and disability of hurricane survivors over an extended period of recovery in a postdisaster setting. Methods: A representative sample of 1077 displaced or greatly affected households was drawn in 2006 using a stratified cluster sampling of federally subsidized emergency housing settings in Louisiana and Mississippi, and of Mississippi census tracts designated as having experienced major damage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Two rounds of data collection were conducted: a baseline face-to-face interview at 6 to 12 months post-Katrina, and a telephone follow-up at 20 to 23 months after the disaster. Mental health disability was measured using the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 12, version 2 mental component summary score. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted examining socioeconomic, demographic, situational, and attitudinal factors associated with mental health distress and disability. Results: More than half of the cohort at both baseline and follow-up reported significant mental health distress. Self-reported poor health and safety concerns were persistently associated with poorer mental health. Nearly 2 years after the disaster, the greatest predictors of poor mental health included situational characteristics such as greater numbers of children in a household and attitudinal characteristics such as fatalistic sentiments and poor self-efficacy. Informal social support networks were associated significantly with better mental health status. Housing and economic circumstances were not independently associated with poorer mental health. Conclusions: Mental health distress and disability are pervasive issues among the US Gulf Coast adults and children who experienced long-term displacement or other serious effects as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As time progresses postdisaster, social and psychological factors may play greater roles in accelerating or impeding recovery among affected populations. Efforts to expand disaster recovery and preparedness policies to include long-term social re-engagement efforts postdisaster should be considered as a means of reducing mental health sequelae.

Mon Repos Conservation Park (an important marine turtle rookery involved in ecotourism) in Queensland, Australia, was selected for this study and visitors were surveyed using a structured questionnaire. The reported on-site experiences of respondents are analysed to identify important factors that alter their stated conservation attitudes and behaviours. The impact of these factors (such as the amount of environmental education that respondents claimed they obtained, sighting of sea turtles, nationality) is quantified using regression analyses. There has been little previous quantification of such influences. The study reveals that a considerable amount of environmental knowledge is gained by visitors to Mon Repos. The ecotourism experience, involving environmental education and seeing of turtles, was found to have positive and statistically significant impacts on the visitors' stated desire and intended behaviour to protect sea turtles. The study reveals the importance of learning and the interaction of tourists with wildlife as a contributor to their pro-conservation sentiments and actions.

Social media, like Twitter, has been increasingly used for exchanging information, opinions and emotions about events that are happening across the world. Here we propose a novel visualization design, Whisper, for tracing the process of information diffusion in social media in real time. Our design highlights three major characteristics of diffusion processes in social media: the temporal trend, social-spatial extent, and community response of a topic of interest. Such social, spatiotemporal processes are conveyed based on a sunflower metaphor whose seeds are often dispersed far away. In Whisper, we summarize the collective responses of communities on a given topic based on how tweets were retweeted by groups of users, through representing the sentiments extracted from the tweets, and tracing the pathways of retweets on a spatial hierarchical layout. We use an efficient flux line-drawing algorithm to trace multiple pathways so the temporal and spatial patterns can be identified even for a bursty event. A focused diffusion series highlights key roles such as opinion leaders in the diffusion process. We demonstrate how our design facilitates the understanding of when and where a piece of information is dispersed and what are the social responses of the crowd, for large-scale events including political campaigns and natural disasters.

The use of traditional revenue sources to pay for the infrastructure necessitated by growth has caused concern that new development is not paying its way. In this paper we are concerned with impact or development fees which have become increasingly popular with planners. While cities in Colorado, Florida and California have taken the lead in implementing impact fee systems, their use is spreading across the nation. The purpose of this paper is to provide an empirical analysis. Specifically, we evaluate the effect that the impact fee has on housing by estimating a reduced form equation for housing prices for a city in Colorado (Loveland) that introduced a cost recovery system in July 1984. We use cross-section data where the sample period includes an eighteen-month period on either side of the introduction of the expanded impact fee system.

Twitter generates a huge volume of instant messages (i.e. tweets) carrying users' sentiments and attitudes every minute, which both necessitates automatic opinion summarization and poses great challenges to the summarization system. In this paper, we study the problem of opinion summarization for entities, such as celebrities and brands, in Twitter. We propose an entity-centric topic-based opinion summarization framework, which aims to produce opinion summaries in accordance with topics and remarkably emphasizing the insight behind the opinions. To this end, we first mine topics from #hashtags, the human-annotated semantic tags in tweets. We integrate the #hashtags as weakly supervised information into topic modeling algorithms to obtain better interpretation and representation for calculating the similarity among them, and adopt Affinity Propagation algorithm to group #hashtags into coherent topics. Subsequently, we use templates generalized from paraphrasing to identify tweets with deep insights, which reveal reasons, express demands or reflect viewpoints. Afterwards, we develop a target (i.e. entity) dependent sentiment classification approach to identifying the opinion towards a given target (i.e. entity) of tweets. Finally, the opinion summary is generated through integrating information from dimensions of topic, opinion and insight, as well as other factors (e.g. topic relevancy, redundancy and language styles) in an unified optimization framework. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-life data set to evaluate the performance of individual opinion summarization modules as well as the quality of the produced summary. The promising experiment results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework and algorithms. © 2012 ACM.",#hashtag; opinion summarization; sentiment analysis; topic analysis; Twitter,#hashtag; opinion summarization; Sentiment analysis; Topic analysis; Twitter; Algorithms; Data mining; Experiments; Quality control; Social networking (online); Natural language processing systems,2-s2.0-84866010125

In view of the complexity of a sentiment like love, it would not be surprising that a diversity of biochemical mechanisms could be involved in the mood changes of the initial stage of a romance. In the present study, we have examined whether the early romantic phase of a loving relationship could be associated with alterations in circulating levels of neurotrophins (NTs). Plasma levels of NGF, BDNF, NT-3 and NT-4 were measured in a total of 58 subjects who had recently fallen in love and compared with those of two control groups, consisting of subjects who were either single or were already engaged in a long-lasting relationship. NGF level was significantly higher (p<0.001) in the subjects in love [mean (SEM): 227 (14) pg/ml] than in either the subjects with a long-lasting relationship [123 (10) pg/ml] or the subjects with no relationship [149 (12) pg/ml]. Notably, there was also a significant positive correlation between levels of NGF and the intensity of romantic love as assessed with the passionate love scale (r=0.34; p=0.007). No differences in the concentrations of other NTs were detected. In 39 subjects in love who - after 12-24 months - maintained the same relationship but were no longer in the same mental state to which they had referred during the initial evaluation, plasma NGF levels decreased and became indistinguishable from those of the control groups. Taken together, these findings suggest that some behavioural and/or psychological features associated with falling in love could be related to raised NGF levels in the bloodstream. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We first apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to discover multi-aspect global topics of social reviews, and then extract the local topic and associated sentiment based on a sliding window context over the review text. The aspect of the local topic is identified by a trained LDA model, and the polarity of the associated sentiment is classified by HowNet lexicon. The experiment results show that MSA-COSR cannot only obtain good topic partitioning results, but also help to improve sentiment analysis accuracy. It helps to simultaneously discover multi-aspect fine-grained topics and associated sentiment. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of this task is to discover the attitude or opinion of the tweets, which is typically formulated as a machine learning based text classification problem. Some methods use manually labeled data to train fully supervised models, while others use some noisy labels, such as emoticons and hashtags, for model training. In general, we can only get a limited number of training data for the fully supervised models because it is very labor-intensive and time-consuming to manually label the tweets. As for the models with noisy labels, it is hard for them to achieve satisfactory performance due to the noise in the labels although it is easy to get a large amount of data for training. Hence, the best strategy is to utilize both manually labeled data and noisy labeled data for training. However, how to seamlessly integrate these two different kinds of data into the same learning framework is still a challenge. In this paper, we present a novel model, called emoticon smoothed language model (ESLAM), to handle this challenge. The basic idea is to train a language model based on the manually labeled data, and then use the noisy emoticon data for smoothing. Experiments on real data sets demonstrate that ESLAM can effectively integrate both kinds of data to outperform those methods using only one of them.

They have become not only a new source of information, but also new mechanisms for societies world-wide to organize themselves and communicate. Therefore, social media has a very strong impact in many aspects - at personal level, in business, and in politics, among many others. In spite of its fast adoption, little is known about social media usage in different countries, and whether patterns of behavior remain the same or not. To provide deep understanding of differences between countries can be useful in many ways, e.g.: to improve the design of social media systems (which features work best for which country?), and influence marketing and political campaigns. Moreover, this type of analysis can provide relevant insight into how societies might differ. In this paper we present a summary of a large-scale analysis of Twitter for an extended period of time. We analyze in detail various aspects of social media for the ten countries we identified as most active. We collected one year's worth of data and report differences and similarities in terms of activity, sentiment, use of languages, and network structure.

This study examines whether local regulations regarding clean indoor air and youth access to tobacco are associated with residents' subsequent perceptions of smoking norms. Data came from Massachusetts surveys of adults and youths and from records of local tobacco control policies. Indices of perceived smoking norms were based on perceived smoking prevalence and perceived community acceptance of smoking. Multilevel models tested the association between perceived norms and the presence of strong local regulations in four policy domains (restaurant smoking bans, smoking restrictions in other venues, enforcement of laws prohibiting sales to youths and youth-oriented marketing restrictions). The model controlled for town voting results on a tobacco tax referendum, which served as a measure of antismoking sentiment pre-dating the regulations. Results showed that youths perceived community norms to be significantly more 'antismoking' if they lived in a town that had strong regulations in at least three of the four domains. For adults, having strong regulations in as few as one to two domains was associated with perceiving community norms to be significantly more antismoking. Implementing and publicizing local regulations may help shape perceptions of community smoking norms. © The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press.

Most previous individual-level empirical studies of cigarette demand are essentially static analyses of the relationship between the level of taxes and smoking behavior at a point in time. In this study, we use longitudinal data to examine the dynamics of young adults' decisions about smoking initiation and cessation. We develop a simple model to highlight the distinctions between smoking initiation, cessation, and participation. We show that because smoking participation reflects past decisions regarding initiation and cessation, the price elasticity of smoking participation is a weighted average of corresponding initiation and cessation elasticities, a finding that applies more broadly to other addictive substances as well. The paper's remaining contributions are empirical. We use data from the 1992 wave of the National Education Longitudinal Study, when most of the cohort were high school seniors, and data from the 2000 wave, when they were about 26 years old. The results show that the distinction between initiation and cessation is empirically useful. We also contribute new estimates on the tax-responsiveness of young adult smoking, paying careful attention to the possibility of bias if hard-to-observe differences in anti-smoking sentiment are correlated with state cigarette taxes. We find no evidence that higher taxes prevent smoking initiation, but some evidence that higher taxes are associated with increased cessation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Especially in the midwestern United States, the relocation of meat and poultry processing plants out of urban centers into rural towns spurred the diversification of formerly white, Anglo-Saxon, and Scandinavian-origin communities. This movement was accelerated by business tax incentives, the proximity of water and grain supplies, and the opportunity to recruit non-union, low-wage workers (Benson 1999; Cantu 1995; Fennelly and Leitner 2002; Griffith 1999; Yeoman 2000).1 In the Midwest, most of those working on meat and poultry industry ""disassembly lines"" are documented and undocumented immigrants from Mexico and Central America, though some towns also contain refugees from Africa and Asia. During the 1990s, foreigners moved to rural communities in such numbers that they helped reverse population losses of the previous decades (Minnesota Planning 1997). In some cases the arrival of large numbers of culturally different residents revitalized rural communities and led to the formation of pro-immigrant coalitions of local citizens and nonprofit agencies, but in other cases immigration led to xenophobia and prejudice among natives, who perceived them as threatening competitors for resources, group identity, and power. The relatively rapid change from predominantly white, European-origin populations to diverse communities with sizable percentages of immigrants offers a natural laboratory for analyzing the perceived threats. In this chapter I present qualitative data gathered in the summer of 2001 for a closeup view of the attitudes of American-born residents toward immigrants in a rural town with a large meat-processing plant. In doing so I compare perceived symbolic and economic threats across three groups of Euro- Americans: community leaders (CL), middle class citizens (MC), and working class residents (WC). Participants' own explanations of their attitudes are used to describe native sentiments within a context of rapid demographic change. The analysis sheds light on the nature of anti-immigrant prejudice and the kinds of public policies that might foster greater empathy. Copyright © 2008 by Russell Sage Foundation.

Pure machine learning usually fails to recognize and interpret emotions in text accurately.

To this end, this paper proposes EmoSenticSpace, a new framework for affective common-sense reasoning that extends WordNet-Affect and SenticNet by providing both emotion labels and polarity scores for a large set of natural language concepts. The framework is built by means of fuzzy c-means clustering and support-vector-machine classification, and takes into account a number of similarity measures, including point-wise mutual information and emotional affinity. EmoSenticSpace was tested on three emotion-related natural language processing tasks, namely sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, and personality detection. In all cases, the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art. In particular, the direct evaluation of EmoSenticSpace against psychological features provided in the benchmark ISEAR dataset shows a 92.15% agreement. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Journalists, scholars, and politicians alike reinforce the perception that anti-Americanism is an entrenched sentiment in many foreign countries. Political scientist Giacomo Chiozza challenges this conventional wisdom, arguing that foreign public opinion about the U.S. is much more diverse and nuanced than is generally believed. Chiozza examines the character, source, and persistence of foreign attitudes toward the United States. His findings are based on worldwide public opinion databases that surveyed anti-American sentiment in Islamic countries, Europe, Latin America, Africa, and East Asia. Data compiled from responses in a wide range of categories-including politics, wealth, science and technology, popular culture, and education-indicate that anti-American sentiments vary widely across these geographic regions. Through careful analyses, Chiozza shows how foreign publics balance the political, social, and cultural dimensions of the U.S. in their own perceptions of the country. He finds that popular anti-Americanism is mostly benign and shallow; deep-seated ideological opposition to the U.S. is usually held among a minority of groups. More often, Chiozza explains, foreigners have conflicting attitudes toward the U.S. He finds that while anti-Americanism certainly exists, the United States is equally praised as a symbol of democracy and freedom, its ideals of liberty, equality, and opportunity applauded. Chiozza clearly demonstrates that what is reported as undisputed fact-that various groups abhor American values-is in reality a complex story. © 2009 The Johns Hopkins University Press.

Based on national survey data from 1,384 Ss, the effects of sentiment relations, choice, and unit relations on voters' perceptions of issue positions taken by presidential candidates in 1968 were analyzed. The major determinant of voters' perceptions was sentiment: Those who admired a candidate tended to see him as promoting policies they themselves favored (assimilation); those displeased with a candidate showed the opposite tendency (contrast), although less consistently and less powerfully. This asymmetrical pattern--greater assimilation than contrast--also characterized the more modt effect of choice. Finally, the unit relation had no direct effect on perception.

Challenging this restrictive dualistic sentiment, this important book argues that social change emerges in a nonlinear, circuitous and dialectic process of struggle between competing poles of action. In support of their approach, the authors: identify four dialectic tensions as being central to the process of organizing for social change: control and emancipation, oppression and empowerment, dissemination and dialogue, and fragmentation and unity; argue for a dialectic approach which acknowledges that contradictory tensions can and do co-exist (for example, a project can control beneficiaries with tough conditionalities even as it emancipates them through economic empowerment); and; draw upon cases set in various contexts-social justice, academic, corporate, artistic, and others-from both developing and developed countries. The authors elaborate their thesis by examining four cases in depth: the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh; the dairy cooperatives of India's National Dairy Development Board; entertainment-education broadcasts and on-the-ground community organizing in Indian villages; and community suppers in Appalachia (USA).

Instead of accepting prima facie the banality of the exception, we submit it to an empirical analysis to show its complexity and ambiguity. Our case study is the political management of the worst natural catastrophe in modern Venezuelan history: the 1999 Tragedia caused by massive landslides triggered by heavy rains on the same day that the country's new constitution was voted. A state of emergency was proclaimed and militarization of the disaster area followed, but instead of being feared or denounced, this governmental response appeared to be desired by the majority of the population. The army, under the leadership of President-Colonel Hugo Chávez, embodied the regeneration of the nation, redeemed from the corruption of the preceding regime and united through communion in solidarity with the victims. Arbitrary violence and ordinary looting eventually occurred, but the dominant moral sentiment expressed at the time was deep compassion. The 1999 Venezuelan scene is, thus, exemplary of a more general phenomenon, described by Claude Lefort as ""the permanence of the theological-political in modern democracies,"" for which the humanitarian state of exception can be seen as a paradigm. © 2005 by the American Anthropological Association.

A new intuitive argument to explain question i is presented and tested in simulations using a computable general equilibrium model with parameters set to be consistent with New Jersey data. Both the intuitive argument and the simulation results indicate that setting local income tax rates to zero is a dominant strategy for community planners. When faced with popular sentiment against the property tax, community planners can collude and introduce local income taxes simultaneously to prevent adverse general equilibrium migration and price changes. Since zero income tax rates are dominant strategies, however, such an agreement is enforceable only if an outsider such as the state government steps in. The institution of state grants funded through a state income tax can play such an enforcement role.",,"general equilibrium analysis; income tax; property tax; tax instrumemt; urban economy; USA, New Jersey",2-s2.0-0030693142

The evolving knowledge gained from multidisciplinary basic research has begun to identify new concepts for treatments and distinct classes of therapeutic targets; as well as putative disease-modifying compounds that are now being tested in clinical trials. There is a mounting consensus that such disease modifying compounds and/or interventions are more likely to be effectively administered as early as possible in the cascade of pathogenic processes preceding and underlying the clinical expression of AD. The budding sentiment is that ""treatments"" need to be applied before various molecular mechanisms converge into an irreversible pathway leading to morphological, metabolic and functional alterations that characterize the pathophysiology of AD. In light of this, biological indicators of pathophysiological mechanisms are desired to chart and detect AD throughout the asymptomatic early molecular stages into the prodromal and early dementia phase. A major conceptual development in the clinical AD research field was the recent proposal of new diagnostic criteria, which specifically incorporate the use of biomarkers as defining criteria for preclinical stages of AD. This paradigm shift in AD definition, conceptualization, operationalization, detection and diagnosis represents novel fundamental opportunities for the modification of interventional trial designs. This perspective summarizes not only present knowledge regarding biological markers but also unresolved questions on the status of surrogate indicators for detection of the disease in asymptomatic people and diagnosis of AD. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Alzheimer's disease; Clinical trials; CSF/blood biomarkers; PET imaging markers; Structural/functional MRI markers,amyloid beta protein[1-40]; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; amyloid precursor protein; biological marker; florbetapir f 18; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; gamma secretase; presenilin 1; presenilin 2; tau protein; Alzheimer disease; basic research; brain atrophy; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; dementia; diagnostic accuracy; diffusion tensor imaging; electroencephalography; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; intervention study; molecular mechanics; national health organization; nerve cell degeneration; neuroimaging; pathophysiology; priority journal; protein expression; resting state network; review; sensitivity and specificity; Alzheimer's disease; Clinical trials; CSF/blood biomarkers; PET imaging markers; Structural/functional MRI markers; Alzheimer Disease; Biological Markers; Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans,2-s2.0-84897954102

Concepts are represented in a general hierarchical framework that is flexible enough to express semantic ontologies, dictionaries, clustering constraints, and, as a special, degenerate case, conventional topic models. Both the topics and the regression are discovered via posterior inference from corpora.

The proposed framework extends from the usual one-issue-at-a-time decision-making to one that involves several related issues simultaneously. Weaknesses of the traditional majority voting mechanism are first identified, and then a different voting method that takes each individual voter's sentiment into account is discussed. Specifically, a decision-maker is asked to express his/her intensity of preference for the issues encountered. Three hierarchical structures-benefits, costs, and risks-are developed to evaluate the alternatives. Due to the nature of pairwise comparisons and synthesis, the proposed method is amenable to consensus building and has higher reliability and consistency. It can be used for candidate selection, e.g. governmental election, when a large population is involved. It is also effective for resource allocation and prioritization when a small group or business is concerned. We believe the proposed approach has potential for resolving deficiencies of the conventional voting mechanism, and can be applied to many real-world problems.

Thus, we can model the compositional effects required for accurate assignment of phrase-level sentiment. For example, combining an adverb (e.g., ""very"") with a positive polar adjective (e.g., ""good"") produces a phrase (""very good"") with increased polarity over the adjective alone. Inspired by recent work on distributional approaches to compositionality, we model each word as a matrix and combine words using iterated matrix multiplication, which allows for the modeling of both additive and multiplicative semantic effects. Although the multiplication-based matrix-space framework has been shown to be a theoretically elegant way to model composition (Rudolph and Giesbrecht, 2010), training such models has to be done carefully: the optimization is non-convex and requires a good initial starting point.

Results: Compared to youths from towns with weak regulations, youths from towns with strong regulations were more likely to perceive lower adult smoking prevalence (odds ratio (OR) 1.71; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 2.84) and social unacceptability of adult smoking (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.08) in their town. Adults from towns with strong regulations were not more likely to perceive lower adult smoking prevalence, but had more than twice the odds of perceiving that smoking was unacceptable in restaurants (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.02) or bars (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.90 to 3.31). Conclusions: Strong local restaurant smoking regulations are associated with favourable smoking related social norms among youths and adults.",,age distribution; air monitor; air monitoring; attitude; government regulation; health program; health survey; human; logistic regression analysis; review; smoking; smoking cessation; social aspect; Adolescent; Adult; Attitude to Health; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Massachusetts; Prevalence; Regression Analysis; Restaurants; Smoking; Social Behavior; Social Perception,2-s2.0-10444237992

We focus on a weighted subsample of 415 nonmetropolitan respondents. Multiple Classification Analysis (MCA) techniques are employed. Contrary to the linear development model, community size did not have an independent inverse impact on community involvement, amity, and sentiment.

Design/methodology/approach: The scientific literature was systematically reviewed to identify relevant empirical studies. These studies were analysed and synthesized in the form of a proposed conceptual framework, which was thereafter applied to further analyse this literature, hence gaining new insights into the field. Findings: The proposed framework reveals that all relevant studies can be decomposed into a small number of steps, and different approaches can be followed in each step. The application of the framework resulted in interesting findings. For example, most studies support SM predictive power, however, more than one-third of these studies infer predictive power without employing predictive analytics. In addition, analysis suggests that there is a clear need for more advanced sentiment analysis methods as well as methods for identifying search terms for collection and filtering of raw SM data. Originality/value: The proposed framework enables researchers to classify and evaluate existing studies, to design scientifically rigorous new studies and to identify the field's weaknesses, hence proposing future research directions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Data analysis; Open data; Social networks; World Wide Web,,2-s2.0-84884999912

We analyze how emoticons typically convey sentiment and demonstrate how we can exploit this by using a novel, manually created emoticon sentiment lexicon in order to improve a state-of-the-art lexicon-based sentiment classification method. We evaluate our approach on 2,080 Dutch tweets and forum messages, which all contain emoticons and have been manually annotated for sentiment. On this corpus, paragraph-level accounting for sentiment implied by emoticons significantly improves sentiment classification accuracy. This indicates that whenever emoticons are used, their associated sentiment dominates the sentiment conveyed by textual cues and forms a good proxy for intended sentiment.

Reviews written by other travelers replace the wordof- mouth, yet turn the search into a time consuming task. Users do not rate enough hotels to enable a collaborative filtering based recommendation. Thus, a cold start recommender system is needed. In this work we design a cold start hotel recommender system, which uses the text of the reviews as its main data. We define context groups based on reviews extracted from TripAdvisor.com and Venere.com. We introduce a novel weighted algorithm for text mining. Our algorithm imitates a user that favors reviews written with the same trip intent and from people of similar background (nationality) and with similar preferences for hotel aspects, which are our defined context groups. Our approach combines numerous elements, including unsupervised clustering to build a vocabulary for hotel aspects, semantic analysis to understand sentiment towards hotel features, and the profiling of intent and nationality groups. We implemented our system which was used by the public to conduct 150 trip planning experiments. We compare our solution to the top suggestions of the mentioned web services and show that users were, on average, 20% more satisfied with our hotel recommendations. We outperform these web services even more in cities where hotel prices are high. Copyright © 2012 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.

Such criticism was based on assumptions concerning relationships among four variables: economic news coverage, public perception of the state of the economy (consumer sentiment), the actual state of the economy, and presidential popularity. This paper seeks to examine the relationships among all four variables in a way that accounts for inherent time series characteristics of the data including: potential non-stationarities (or tendencies for the series to drift over time) and co-movements among the series. Hypotheses concerning the nature and direction of influence among the four variables are proposed and time series analyses are conducted to test each hypothesis. We use recession-related headlines from the New York Times to represent economic news. Each series is analyzed to isolate its principal characteristics, and tests for co-movement (formally, cointegration) between the series are conducted. Vector autoregression is used to model the joint determination of the series, and tests for Granger causality are conducted. The results show some causal evidence for a media effect: recession headlines were a significant prior influence on the determination of consumer sentiment in this study. There is some limited evidence of an adversarial press effect, wherein the president's growing popularity rather than real world economic conditions appears to have led an increase in the number of recession headlines. © 1995 World Association for Public Opinion Research.",,,2-s2.0-0002537540

However, the field of supply chain management (SCM) has been relatively slow in studying social media and big data for research and practice. In these contexts, this research contributes to the SCM community by proposing a novel, analytical framework (Twitter Analytics) for analyzing supply chain tweets, highlighting the current use of Twitter in supply chain contexts, and further developing insights into the potential role of Twitter for supply chain practice and research. The proposed framework combines three methodologies - descriptive analytics (DA), content analytics (CA) integrating text mining and sentiment analysis, and network analytics (NA) relying on network visualization and metrics - for extracting intelligence from 22,399 #supplychain tweets. Some of the findings are: supply chain tweets are used by different groups of supply chain professionals and organizations (e.g., news services, IT companies, logistic providers, manufacturers) for information sharing, hiring professionals, and communicating with stakeholders, among others; diverse topics are being discussed, ranging from logistics and corporate social responsibility, to risk, manufacturing, SCM IT and even human rights; some tweets carry strong sentiments about companies' delivery services, sales performance, and environmental standards, and risk and disruption in supply chains. Based on these findings, this research presents insights into the use and potential role of Twitter for supply chain practices (e.g., professional networking, stakeholder engagement, demand shaping, new product/service development, supply chain risk management) and the implications for research. Finally, the limitations of the current study and suggestions for future research are presented. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Application Programming Interface (API); Big data; Content analytics; Data analytics; Network analytics; Social media analytics; Supply chain management; Twitter,Application programming interfaces (API); Big data; Chains; Computer systems programming; Data mining; Economic and social effects; Information management; Manufacture; Natural language processing systems; Research and development management; Risk management; Social networking (online); Content analytics; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Data analytics; Environmental standards; Social media analytics; Supply chain managements (SCM); Supply chain risk management; Twitter; Supply chain management,2-s2.0-84929513110

To address the issue, several knowledge-based models have been proposed to incorporate prior knowledge provided by the user to guide modeling. In this paper, we take a major step forward and show that in the big data era, without any user input, it is possible to learn prior knowledge automatically from a large amount of review data available on the Web. Such knowledge can then be used by a topic model to discover more coherent aspects. There are two key challenges: (1) learning quality knowledge from reviews of diverse domains, and (2) making the model fault-tolerant to handle possibly wrong knowledge. A novel approach is proposed to solve these problems. Experimental results using reviews from 36 domains show that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. © 2014 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,Computational linguistics; Extraction; Knowledge based systems; Diverse domains; Fault-tolerant; Knowledge-based model; Large amounts; Learning quality; Prior knowledge; Sentiment analysis; Topic Modeling; Big data,2-s2.0-84906929305

In recent years, more and more people express their opinions about products online, and both the feedback of manufacturers' products or their competitors' products could be easily collected. However, it's impossible for manufacturers to read every review to analyze the weakness of their products. Therefore, finding product weakness from online reviews becomes a meaningful work. In this paper, we introduce such an expert system, Weakness Finder, which can help manufacturers find their product weakness from Chinese reviews by using aspects based sentiment analysis. An aspect is an attribute or component of a product, such as price, degerm, moisturizing are the aspects of the body wash products. Weakness Finder extracts the features and groups explicit features by using morpheme based method and Hownet based similarity measure, and identify and group the implicit features with collocation selection method for each aspect. Then utilize sentence based sentiment analysis method to determine the polarity of each aspect in sentences. The weakness of product could be found because the weakness is probably the most unsatisfied aspect in customers' reviews, or the aspect which is more unsatisfied when compared with their competitor's product reviews. Weakness Finder has been used to help a body wash manufacturer find their product weakness, and our experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the Weakness Finder. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, topic models have been introduced for the simultaneous analysis for topics and the sentiment in a document. These studies, which jointly model topic and sentiment, take the advantage of the relationship between topics and sentiment, and are shown to be superior to traditional sentiment analysis tools. However, most of them make the assumption that, given the parameters, the sentiments of the words in the document are all independent. In our observation, in contrast, sentiments are expressed in a coherent way. The local conjunctive words, such as ""and"" or ""but"", are of ten indicative of sentiment transitions. In this paper, we propose a major departure from the previous approaches by making two linked contributions. First, we assume that the sentiments are related to the topic in the document, and put forward a joint sentiment and topic model, i.e. Sentiment-LDA. Second, we observe that sentiments are dependent on local context. Thus, we further extend the Sentiment-LDA model to Dependency- Sentiment-LDA model by relaxing the sentiment independent assumption in Sentiment-LDA. The sentiments of words are viewed as a Markov chain in Dependency-Sentiment-LDA. Through experiments, we show that exploiting the sentiment dependency is clearly advantageous, and that the Dependency-Sentiment- LDA is an effective approach for sentiment analysis.

The paper seeks to represent the textures and intricacies that arise as the interdependencies among status, pleasure, appropriation, seduction and livelihood are worked out. It examines how these operations themselves elaborate a landscape of possibilities always on the verge of overflowing established sense and sentiments, yet somehow reined in, held, albeit in a highly tenuous relationship, to what is known and valued. The city makes itself urban, despite the nearly impossible economic and political conditions it faces, through a capacity to narrate these tales of fishing (as well as fishy stories), but also always trying to chase, to catch up with its capacity to proliferate words. Written against the background of the threat posed by HIV/AIDS in Africa, the paper also draws attention to the need for further scholarly research on the lethal cocktail of the twin globalization of consumerism and poverty in marginal sites of accumulation pregnant with contradictions and uncertainties such as Africa.",,economic impact; globalization; human immunodeficiency virus; prostitution; sexual behavior; sexually transmitted disease; Africa; Dakar [Senegal]; Eastern Hemisphere; Senegal; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa; World,2-s2.0-27544463418

The scale comprises 8 a priori thinking styles and two validation scales, the validation scales having been found to be unreliable. Owing to the large amount of apparently shared variance in the original validation study, this data matrix needs re-analysis. Results from the PICTS were examined in relation to general measures of individual differences, in order to link the PICTS to the broader literature on the characteristics of offenders. Method: The original PICTS data-matrix was re-analysed using a more parsimonious method of analysis. The PICYS was also given to 54 detained, mentally disordered offenders along with the NEO-Five Factor Inventory, the Sensation-Seeking Scale (SSS), the Attention Deficit Scales for Adults (ADSA) and, as a measure of general intelligence, the Standard Progressive Matrices. Results; Principal components analysis suggested that the PICTS really comprised two factors: A lack of thoughtfulness (i.e. lack of attention to one's experience), and wilful hostility, with the first factor being most well defined. Intelligence was not associated with any factor of criminal thinking style. High scores on the ADSA and Disinhibition and Boredom Susceptibility subscales of the SSS were associated with much greater endorsement of criminal sentiments; high Neuroticism, low Extroversion, and low Agreeableness were slightly lower correlates. Discussion: The issues involved in criminogenic cognitions need clarification and to be linked to the broader literature on cognitive distortions and personality. Interventions targeted at dismantling impulsive destructive behaviour, whether it be thoughtlessness or wilful hostility, may be effected by increasing thinking skills, so breaking down the cognitions that maintain criminal behaviour.",,article; attention deficit disorder; cognition; criminal behavior; extraversion; human; intelligence; mental disease; neurosis; personality; principal component analysis; psychologic test; psychometry; sensation,2-s2.0-0034502395

(Clausewitz) In this article I have shown that in times of war, beneath the apparently rational surface of modern societies and states there lurks a powerful religious dimension that is of crucial importance in structuring political and military activity, in informing public, political, and intellectual discourse, and in shaping opinion, beliefs, attitudes, sentiments, and social action. The religious dimension is neither a mere jumble of diffuse sentiments, beliefs, and ideas, nor a simple ideological reflection of social interests - it is an autonomous, internally coherent, analogically organized code that specifies sacred and profane elements and embodies an endogenous apophantic logic. This analytically autonomous code provides for the specification of war as ritual in concrete historical sequences. If the reader comes away from this article feeling that she better understands the role and organization of culture in war, and that consequently war cannot be explained, understood, and interpreted only in terms of economic, geopolitical, and psychological variables, then I will have achieved my chief objective here. However, I hope that this article also has a larger contribution to make. Sociology has inherited a rich tradition of ideas from its founding fathers. This tradition, enshrined in the classic works of Marx, Weber, and Durkheim, has informed and shaped the discipline. It seems a shame that contemporary trends in social thought and research draw increasingly upon selected strands of thought in the legacy of only two of those gentlemen. The result of this movement, I believe, is not just a trend toward impoverished uni-dimensional studies of social reality, but also the loss of the auto-critical possibilities engendered by a discourse that draws upon diverse theoretical resources. As I have tried to demonstrate here, Durkheim's legacy, with its unique emphasis on ritual and symbolism, still provides a useful resource for the critique of social theory and the analysis of social life - even in those areas where one would least expect any fruitful insights to arise. More importantly, as Clausewitz recognized, theory contains the possibility not merely for the formal study, but also for the critical study of war. With its stress on voluntarism, a Durkheimian theory of war provides a vital and distinct contrast to those theories of war that attribute causation to factors outside of human control, be they psychological, geopolitical, or economic. The awareness of ethical responsibility arising from such an under-standing provides, one would like to think, the possibility for change. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,2-s2.0-0007195491

Billions of users regularly download, use, and review these apps. Recent studies have shown that reviews written by the users represent a rich source of information for the app vendors and the developers, as they include information about bugs, ideas for new features, or documentation of released features. This paper introduces several probabilistic techniques to classify app reviews into four types: bug reports, feature requests, user experiences, and ratings. For this we use review metadata such as the star rating and the tense, as well as, text classification, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis techniques. We conducted a series of experiments to compare the accuracy of the techniques and compared them with simple string matching. We found that metadata alone results in a poor classification accuracy. When combined with natural language processing, the classification precision got between 70-95% while the recall between 80-90%. Multiple binary classifiers outperformed single multiclass classifiers. Our results impact the design of review analytics tools which help app vendors, developers, and users to deal with the large amount of reviews, filter critical reviews, and assign them to the appropriate stakeholders. © 2015 IEEE.",,Application programs; Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Metadata; Requirements engineering; Text processing; Binary classifiers; Classification accuracy; Classification precision; Multi-class classifier; NAtural language processing; Probabilistic technique; Sentiment analysis; Text classification; Natural language processing systems,2-s2.0-84962343744

While users were merely information consumers in the traditional Web, they play a much more active role in the Social Web since they are now also data providers. The mass involved in the process of creating Web content has led many public and private organizations to focus their attention on analyzing this content in order to ascertain the general public's opinions as regards a number of topics. Given the current Web size and growth rate, automated techniques are essential if practical and scalable solutions are to be obtained. Opinion mining is a highly active research field that comprises natural language processing, computational linguistics and text analysis techniques with the aim of extracting various kinds of added-value and informational elements from users' opinions. However, current opinion mining approaches are hampered by a number of drawbacks such as the absence of semantic relations between concepts in feature search processes or the lack of advanced mathematical methods in sentiment analysis processes. In this paper we propose an innovative opinion mining methodology that takes advantage of new Semantic Web-guided solutions to enhance the results obtained with traditional natural language processing techniques and sentiment analysis processes. The main goals of the proposed methodology are: (1) to improve feature-based opinion mining by using ontologies at the feature selection stage, and (2) to provide a new vector analysis-based method for sentiment analysis. The methodology has been implemented and thoroughly tested in a real-world movie review-themed scenario, yielding very promising results when compared with other conventional approaches.© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In a decision making context, one of the most relevant tasks is polarity classification of a text source, which is usually performed through supervised learning methods. Most of the existing approaches select the best classification model leading to over-confident decisions that do not take into account the inherent uncertainty of the natural language. In this paper, we pursue the paradigm of ensemble learning to reduce the noise sensitivity related to language ambiguity and therefore to provide a more accurate prediction of polarity. The proposed ensemble method is based on Bayesian Model Averaging, where both uncertainty and reliability of each single model are taken into account. We address the classifier selection problem by proposing a greedy approach that evaluates the contribution of each model with respect to the ensemble. Experimental results on gold standard datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms both traditional classification and ensemble methods. © 2014 The Authors.

Previous works model news pieces in bag-of-words space, which analyzes the latent relationship between word statistical patterns and stock price movements. However, news sentiment, which is an important ring on the chain of mapping from the word patterns to the price movements, is rarely touched. In this paper, we first implement a generic stock price prediction framework, and plug in six different models with different analyzing approaches. To take one step further, we use Harvard psychological dictionary and Loughran-McDonald financial sentiment dictionary to construct a sentiment space. Textual news articles are then quantitatively measured and projected onto the sentiment space. Instance labeling method is rigorously discussed and tested. We evaluate the models' prediction accuracy and empirically compare their performance at different market classification levels. Experiments are conducted on five years historical Hong Kong Stock Exchange prices and news articles. Results show that (1) at individual stock, sector and index levels, the models with sentiment analysis outperform the bag-of-words model in both validation set and independent testing set; (2) the models which use sentiment polarity cannot provide useful predictions; (3) there is a minor difference between the models using two different sentiment dictionaries. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

By focusing only on the subjective expressions and ignoring the entities, we can choose more salient features for document-level sentiment analysis.

Although a number of authors have charted changes in support for restrictionist immigration policies, few have examined their determinants.

In a series of regression analyses, this hypothesis is confirmed; rural residents hold the most restrictionist views. Additional analyses indicate that this effect of rural residence on policy attitudes is mediated by attitudes toward multiculturalism, the perceived traits of immigrants, and perceptions about the costs of immigration. Ultimately, the analyses indicate that the perceived cost of immigration is the single strongest predictor of support for restrictive immigration policies, and that it best accounts for rural residents'more restrictionist views. © 2008 IOM.",,attitudinal survey; immigration policy; international migration; multiculturalism; regression analysis; rural population,2-s2.0-38849143149

This paper analyzes whether the sentiment expressed in Twitter feeds, which discuss selected companies and their products, can indicate their stock price changes. To address this problem, an active learning approach was developed and applied to sentiment analysis of tweet streams in the stock market domain. The paper first presents a static Twitter data analysis problem, explored in order to determine the best Twitter-specific text preprocessing setting for training the Support Vector Machine (SVM) sentiment classifier. In the static setting, the Granger causality test shows that sentiments in stock-related tweets can be used as indicators of stock price movements a few days in advance, where improved results were achieved by adapting the SVM classifier to categorize Twitter posts into three sentiment categories of positive, negative and neutral (instead of positive and negative only). These findings were adopted in the development of a new stream-based active learning approach to sentiment analysis, applicable in incremental learning from continuously changing financial tweet streams. To this end, a series of experiments was conducted to determine the best querying strategy for active learning of the SVM classifier adapted to sentiment analysis of financial tweet streams. The experiments in analyzing stock market sentiments of a particular company show that changes in positive sentiment probability can be used as indicators of the changes in stock closing prices. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Social Computing is a novel and emerging computing paradigm that involves a multi-disciplinary approach in analyzing and modeling social behaviors on different media and platforms to produce intelligent and interactive applications and results. In this paper, we give a brief survey of the various machine learning and computational techniques used in Social Computing by first examining the social platforms, e.g., social network sites, social media, social games, social bookmarking, and social knowledge sites, where computational methodology is required to collect, extract, process, mine, and visualize the data. We then present surveys on more specific instances of computation tasks and techniques, e.g., social network analysis, link modeling and mining, ranking, sentiment analysis, etc., that are being used on these social platforms to obtain desirable results. Lastly, we present a small subset of an extensive reference list, which contains over 140 highly relevant references relating to the recent development in the computational aspects of Social Computing. © 2009 IEEE.",Collaborative filtering; Graph mining; Human computing; Link analysis; Ranking; Sentiment analysis; Social Computing; Social media; Social networks; Social tagging,Collaborative filtering; Graph mining; Human computing; Link analysis; Ranking; Sentiment analysis; Social Computing; Social media; Social networks; Social tagging; Electric network analysis; Mining; Neural networks; Signal filtering and prediction; Surveys; Wireless sensor networks; Computer science,2-s2.0-70449410950

Initially, reformers focused attention on the establishment of local self-government. Public sector reform at the regional level did not immediately follow. Communist-era regional bodies were perceived to be legacies of authoritarian rule whose reform would be extremely complex. In the immediate transition period these reforms fell to the bottom of already crowded political agendas. By the late 1990s only a few countries had embarked on regional administrative and territorial reform. Among them were Poland and the Czech Republic. These two cases illustrate how a variety of factors determine (1) whether a country embarks on regional reforms and, when it does, (2) the scope and nature of the reforms. Region building is shaped by a country's historical legacy, the political environment at the time of its transition, the degree of regionalist sentiment in society, as well as the prospect of accession to the European Union. These factors, discussed further below, also help to explain the variation in regional reform processes and outcomes. This analysis begins by examining the conceptual and theoretical dimensions of decentralisation and regionalisation. The focus then turns to the reform processes in Poland and the Czech Republic. Though too early to judge the impact of the reforms, the article concludes with some preliminary indications of their strengths and weaknesses and suggests areas for future research.",,administrative reform; decentralization; post-communism; regionalization; Czech Republic; Poland,2-s2.0-0037367427

Social surveys are efficient and effective ways to generate this information from a representative sample of the larger public who may care about national forests but do not attend participatory events - the so-called silent majority. Survey results can be used to complement input generated from participatory and collaborative processes. This paper presents results and discusses implications from social surveys conducted on three national forests in Colorado and Wyoming. The results indicate that although respondents identified aesthetic, biodiversity, future and recreation value orientations as most important, there are also surprising linkages between value orientations, attitudes and preferences towards forest uses and policy options associated with specific geographic and socio-economic contexts and conditions. The results also suggest some "" hotspots"" where value orientations, attitudes and preferences display some apparent contradictions. Such hotspots indicate potential conflicts and suggest opportunities to focus participatory, collaborative methods. The relevance of these results to national forest planning in particular and public resource management is explored in the discussion and conclusion, especially as the USFS - and other public resource management agencies - face increased pressure to make room for place-based, collaborative planning while also taking into account broader public sentiments and preferences. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Forest planning; Forest Service; National forests; Social research; Social values and attitudes; Survey methods,biodiversity; ecosystem service; environmental planning; forest management; survey; Colorado; United States; Wyoming,2-s2.0-78649464971

During the fall, when political activity and media attention were at their peaks, aggregate presidential preferences remained largely unchanged.

Using comparable data for Canada and the United States, it analyzes the degree to which the education and income levels of occupations influence occupational prestige judgements by evoking affective associations (feelings about the goodness, powerfulness, and liveliness of occupational identities), as well as the extent to which these social sentiments are independent determinants of prestige. There has been a longstanding controversy about the normative content of occupational prestige scores. We find that moral worthiness (as measured by the Evaluation dimension of the semantic differential) is a determinant of the prestige of occupations with low and middle but not high levels of education and income. We also find that the impact of education on prestige scores is direct and cognitive, while a considerable proportion of the total effect of income is processed through feelings about the potency of occupations. The results for the two countries are very similar. One exception is that moral worthiness is a more important determinant of prestige in the United States than in Canada.

In this work, computational intelligence techniques are combined with common-sense computing and linguistics to analyze sentiment data flows, i.e., to automatically decode how humans express emotions and opinions via natural language. The increasing availability of social data is extremely beneficial for tasks such as branding, product positioning, corporate reputation management, and social media marketing. The elicitation of useful information from this huge amount of unstructured data, however, remains an open challenge. Although such data are easily accessible to humans, they are not suitable for automatic processing: machines are still unable to effectively and dynamically interpret the meaning associated with natural language text in very large, heterogeneous, noisy, and ambiguous environments such as the Web. We present a novel methodology that goes beyond mere word-level analysis of text and enables a more efficient transformation of unstructured social data into structured information, readily interpretable by machines. In particular, we describe a novel paradigm for real-time concept-level sentiment analysis that blends computational intelligence, linguistics, and common-sense computing in order to improve the accuracy of computationally expensive tasks such as polarity detection from big social data. The main novelty of the paper consists in an algorithm that assigns contextual polarity to concepts in text and flows this polarity through the dependency arcs in order to assign a final polarity label to each sentence. Analyzing how sentiment flows from concept to concept through dependency relations allows for a better understanding of the contextual role of each concept in text, to achieve a dynamic polarity inference that outperforms state-of-the-art statistical methods in terms of both accuracy and training time. © 2015 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Data flow analysis; Data transfer; Linguistics; Marketing; Natural language processing systems; Automatic processing; Computational intelligence techniques; Corporate reputations; Dependency relation; Natural language text; Product positioning; Social media marketings; Structured information; Metadata,2-s2.0-84944871800

These reactions can correspond to a wide range of intensities, from very mild to strong. An adequate processing and understanding of these expressions has been the subject of research in several fields, such as business and politics. In this context, Twitter sentiment analysis, which is the task of automatically identifying and extracting subjective information from tweets, has received increasing attention from the Web mining community. Twitter provides an extremely valuable insight into human opinions, as well as new challenging Big Data problems. These problems include the processing of massive volumes of streaming data, as well as the automatic identification of human expressiveness within short text messages. In that area, several methods and lexical resources have been proposed in order to extract sentiment indicators from natural language texts at both syntactic and semantic levels. These approaches address different dimensions of opinions, such as subjectivity, polarity, intensity and emotion. This article is the first study of how these resources, which are focused on different sentiment scopes, complement each other. With this purpose we identify scenarios in which some of these resources are more useful than others. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach for sentiment classification based on meta-level features. This supervised approach boosts existing sentiment classification of subjectivity and polarity detection on Twitter. Our results show that the combination of meta-level features provides significant improvements in performance. However, we observe that there are important differences that rely on the type of lexical resource, the dataset used to build the model, and the learning strategy. Experimental results indicate that manually generated lexicons are focused on emotional words, being very useful for polarity prediction. On the other hand, lexicons generated with automatic methods include neutral words, introducing noise in the detection of subjectivity. Our findings indicate that polarity and subjectivity prediction are different dimensions of the same problem, but they need to be addressed using different subspace features.

In this article, we propose an efficient algorithm and three pruning strategies to automatically build a word-level emotional dictionary for social emotion detection. In the dictionary, each word is associated with the distribution on a series of human emotions. In addition, a method based on topic modeling is proposed to construct a topic-level dictionary, where each topic is correlated with social emotions. Experiment on the real-world data sets has validated the effectiveness and reliability of the methods. Compared with other lexicons, the dictionary generated using our approach is language-independent, fine-grained, and volume-unlimited. The generated dictionary has a wide range of applications, including predicting the emotional distribution of news articles, identifying social emotions on certain entities and news events. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Emotional dictionary; Social emotion detection; Topic modeling; Web 2.0,Algorithms; Virtual reality; Human emotion; News articles; On-line documents; Pruning strategy; Sentiment analysis; Social emotions; Topic Modeling; Web 2.0; Data mining,2-s2.0-84902327925

Then, we define three fuzzy sets to represent the respective sentiment polarity classes, namely positive, negative and neutral sentiments. Based on sentence sentiment intensities, we further build membership functions to indicate the degrees of an opinionated sentence in different fuzzy sets.

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) estimates that approximately 9 percent of all men will serve some time in state or federal prisons, with considerably higher figures for blacks (about 30 percent) and Latinos (16 percent). These trends are especially pronounced for California and, within California, for Los Angeles. California houses a disproportionate share of the nation's recently released prisoners. In 2001, roughly 23 percent of the 600,000 prisoners released during the year resided in California, though the state accounted for only 11 percent of the national population. What's more, nearly one-third of the 140,000 California state prisoners released in 2001 returned to Los Angeles County.1 Reintegrating this growing population of ex-prison inmates into noninstitutionalized society is a top policy problem faced by state and local governments throughout the nation. Reintegration failures often result in additional crimes committed by ex-inmates (Raphael and Stoll 2004), further incarceration spells for released inmates, and, given the racial composition of ex-offenders, a greater degree of racial socioeconomic inequality (Holzer, Offner, and Sorenson 2005). Gainful employment opportunities for ex-offenders are important for facilitating the successful reintegration of released inmates. How- ever, suitable employment opportunities for ex-offenders are likely to be scarce, relative to the supply of ex-offenders, for a number of reasons. 2 To start, having served time is likely to diminish workers' value to potential employers, for the workers' human capital may depreciate while they are incarcerated, as they fail to accumulate additional work experience, and as incarceration may negatively affect the ""soft skills"" that employers value. Beyond these supply-side effects, however, ex-offenders are also likely to encounter reluctance among potential employers to hire workers with criminal history records. Employers in businesses that entail frequent customer contact may avoid hiring ex-offenders in the belief that former inmates are likely to victimize customers, exposing the employer to potential legal liability. Moreover, some employers in certain industries and hiring into certain occupations are legally prohibited from hiring ex-offenders. In earlier work on employer demand for ex-offenders, we demonstrate many of the demand-side barriers that ex-offenders face and the impact of employer sentiments on hiring outcomes. Specifically, using establishment surveys (establishments are businesses that hire workers) from the early 1990s we documented the strong reluctance of employers to hire ex-offenders, the types of employers that will and will not hire ex-offenders, as well as the interaction between employer aversion to ex-offenders and screening behavior. With respect to the latter topic, we document the extent to which employers formally screen the criminal history records of applicants or informally screen by statistically discriminating against applicants with demographic characteristics (such as race and gender) perceived to be correlated with the likelihood of having a criminal past (Holzer, Raphael, and Stoll 2004, 2006a, 2006b).3 While instructive, these earlier research efforts relied on fairly crude measures of employer sentiment regarding ex-offenders and a very vaguely worded question regarding whether the employer checks criminal backgrounds. In this chapter we analyze a more recent survey of employers in the Los Angeles metropolitan area that includes considerably more detailed information regarding employer sentiments about ex-offenders, actual hiring behavior with respect to ex-offenders, and the methods used to screen the criminal histories of applicants. With this new survey we present empirical evidence regarding a number of basic questions that could not be answered with existing employer data. For example, does employer willingness to hire ex-offenders vary with the nature of the offense committed? Does an employer's stated aversion to exoffenders correlate with actual hiring behavior? How exactly do most employers check the criminal histories of applicants, and at what point in the hiring process? We investigate these questions using a survey of employers in Los Angeles carried out during the year 2001. While many of the results confirm our earlier findings, we are able to paint a more nuanced portrait of how employers consider criminal history records in making hiring decisions. Our analysis reveals that, although a substantial fraction of employers indicate that they would probably not hire an ex-offender, a sizable number are willing to consider mitigating factors, such as the type of offense committed and when the offense occurred. This suggests that employer demand for ex-offenders, though low, may be more flexible than previously believed. In addition, we find that the use of criminal history checks has increased considerably over the past decade, with a substantial fraction of employers using private services to perform such checks. Finally, we investigate the correlates of the use of criminal background checks and the likelihood that employers have recently hired an ex-offender. In general, larger establishments with more formal human resource systems screen the criminal backgrounds of employees. Regarding hiring, firms that are legally prohibited from hiring ex-offenders, as well as employers hiring into jobs involving customer contact, the handling of cash, and interaction with children are considerably less likely to hire felons.

Claims have been made that if citizens' experiences with the state tell them that the government is efficacious, fair and trustworthy, then the odds for supporting publicly financed welfare policies are higher compared to a situation when their experiences with government feed feelings of inefficiency, corruption, unfairness and arbitrary discretion. The general question guiding the empirical analysis is the following: Is distrust in institutional capability an important prerequisite for general welfare state support withdrawal? Relying on Swedish nationally representative survey data, this issue is examined using Latent Class Analysis (LCA). Empirical evidence suggests that distrust in the institutional capability of the welfare state has not translated into widespread anti-welfare state sentiments. For some citizens, distrust in the capability of the welfare state is an issue of insufficient resources and they are willing to increase social spending in order to improve social services and benefits. For other citizens, distrust is closely connected with anti-welfare state sentiments. The article discusses the implications of the results for arguments about institutional trust and welfare state support.

The results of an attitudinal survey of 185 affluent, mostly White residents of a suburb 25 miles north of Dallas, Texas, are reported. Four hypotheses were developed and used to assess what aspects of residential preference may be linked to an acceptance of traditional urban-ism concepts. The findings indicate that residents are very attached to their neighborhood and are unlikely to accept criticisms of their suburban lifestyle. Further, agreement with traditional urbanism concepts was associated with a perceived failure of the physical planning aspects of suburban development such as access to services. The conclusion is that in general, affluent suburban residents are likely to base any disfavor with suburban living on factors that affect them in very practical ways and not on a lack of community sentiment or a sense of the social or environmental weaknesses of suburban development. The findings also support the view that residential preferences are not inflexible and are sometimes even contradictory. This adaptability suggests that education about the impacts of development may be warranted. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,attitudinal survey; perception; public attitude; residential location; suburban area; United States,2-s2.0-0035015048

In order to cope with the growth of such so much multimodal data, there is an urgent need to develop an intelligent multi-modal analysis framework that can effectively extract information from multiple modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal information extraction agent, which infers and aggregates the semantic and affective information associated with user-generated multimodal data in contexts such as e-learning, e-health, automatic video content tagging and human-computer interaction. In particular, the developed intelligent agent adopts an ensemble feature extraction approach by exploiting the joint use of tri-modal (text, audio and video) features to enhance the multimodal information extraction process. In preliminary experiments using the eNTERFACE dataset, our proposed multi-modal system is shown to achieve an accuracy of 87.95%, outperforming the best state-of-the-art system by more than 10%, or in relative terms, a 56% reduction in error rate. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Affective computing; Emotion analysis; Facial expressions; Multimodal; Multimodal sentiment analysis; Speech; Text,E-learning; Feature extraction; Human computer interaction; Information retrieval; Modal analysis; Semantics; Social networking (online); Speech; Affective Computing; Emotion analysis; Facial Expressions; Multi-modal; Sentiment analysis; Text; Data mining; affect; Article; audio recording; automated pattern recognition; classifier; data analysis; data extraction; data processing; emotion; facial expression; human; knowledge base; learning algorithm; machine learning; measurement accuracy; multimedia; multimodal data analysis; semantics; support vector machine; videorecording; written language; algorithm; artificial intelligence; biometry; information retrieval; procedures; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Biometric Identification; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval,2-s2.0-84917739875

Today, that much information is created weekly. The opportunity to capture the opinions of the general public about social events, political movements, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product preferences has raised increasing interest both in the scientific community, for the exciting open challenges, and in the business world, for the remarkable fallouts in marketing and financial prediction. Keeping up with the ever-growing amount of unstructured information on the Web, however, is a formidable task and requires fast and efficient models for opinion mining. In this paper, we explore how the high generalization performance, low computational complexity, and fast learning speed of extreme learning machines can be exploited to perform analogical reasoning in a vector space model of affective common-sense knowledge. In particular, by enabling a fast reconfiguration of such a vector space, extreme learning machines allow the polarity associated with natural language concepts to be calculated in a more dynamic and accurate way and, hence, perform better concept-level sentiment analysis. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Analogical reasoning; Artificial intelligence; Extreme learning machine; Natural language processing; Opinion mining,Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Computational complexity; Data mining; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Learning systems; Marketing; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Analogical reasoning; Extreme learning machine; Fast reconfiguration; Financial prediction; Generalization performance; Low computational complexity; NAtural language processing; Opinion mining; Vector spaces; Article; artificial intelligence; conceptual framework; decomposition; emotionality; extreme learning machine; machine learning; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; molecular dynamics; natural language processing; principal component analysis; probability; semantics; support vector machine; truncated singular value decomposition,2-s2.0-84969228568

In this paper, we propose a supervised term weighting scheme based on two basic factors: Importance of a term in a document (ITD) and importance of a term for expressing sentiment (ITS), to improve the performance of analysis. For ITD, we explore three definitions based on term frequency. Then, seven statistical functions are employed to learn the ITS of each term from training documents with category labels. Compared with the previous unsupervised term weighting schemes originated from information retrieval, our scheme can make full use of the available labeling information to assign appropriate weights to terms.

Customer reviews are recognized as fruitful information sources for monitoring and enhancing customer satisfaction levels, particularly as they convey the real voices of actual customers expressing relatively unambiguous opinions. As a methodological means of customer review analysis, sentiment analysis has come to the fore. Although several sentiment analysis approaches have proposed extraction of the emotional information from customer reviews, however, a lacuna remains as to how to effectively analyze customer reviews for the purpose of monitoring customer satisfaction with mobile services. In response, the present study developed a new framework for measurement of customer satisfaction for mobile services by combining VIKOR (in Serbian: ViseKriterijumsa Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) and sentiment analysis. With VIKOR, which is a compromise ranking method of the multicriteria decision making (MCDM) approach, customer satisfaction for mobile services can be accurately measured by a sentiment-analysis scheme that simultaneously considers maximum group utility and individual regret. The suggested framework consists mainly of two stages: data collection and preprocessing, and measurement of customer satisfaction. In the first, data collection and preprocessing stage, text mining is utilized to compile customer-review-based dictionaries of attributes and sentiment words. Then, using sentiment analysis, sentiment scores for attributes are calculated for each mobile service. In the second stage, levels of customer satisfaction are measured using VIKOR. For the purpose of illustration, an empirical case study was conducted on customer reviews of mobile application services. We believe that the proposed customer-review-based approach not only saves time and effort in measuring customer satisfaction, but also captures the real voices of customers. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, stable Twitter sentiment classification performance remains elusive due to several issues: heavy class imbalance in a multi-class problem, representational richness issues for sentiment cues, and the use of diverse colloquial linguistic patterns. These issues are problematic since many forms of social media analytics rely on accurate underlying Twitter sentiments. Accordingly, a text analytics framework is proposed for Twitter sentiment analysis. The framework uses an elaborate bootstrapping ensemble to quell class imbalance, sparsity, and representational richness issues. Experiment results reveal that the proposed approach is more accurate and balanced in its predictions across sentiment classes, as compared to various comparison tools and algorithms. Consequently, the bootstrapping ensemble framework is able to build sentiment time series that are better able to reflect events eliciting strong positive and negative sentiments from users. Considering the importance of Twitter as one of the premiere social media platforms, the results have important implications for social media analytics and social intelligence. © 2013 IEEE.",Machine learning; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Social media analytics; Text mining,Multi-class problems; Negative sentiments; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Social media analytics; Social media platforms; Text mining; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Text processing; Data mining,2-s2.0-84893603417

Our main contribution is to present evidence that social media, with appropriate natural language processing techniques, can be a valuable and abundant data source for the study of bullying in both worlds. We identify several key problems in using such data sources and formulate them as NLP tasks, including text classification, role labeling, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.

Consumer reviews are essential for retailers and product manufacturers to understand the general responses of customers to their products and improve their marketing campaigns or products accordingly. In addition, consumer reviews enable retailers to recognize the specific preferences of each customer, which facilitates effective marketing decisions. As the number of consumer reviews expands, it is essential and desirable to develop an efficient and effective sentiment analysis technique that is capable of extracting product features stated in consumer reviews (i. e., product feature extraction) and determining the sentiments (positive or negative semantic orientations) of consumers for these product features (i. e., opinion orientation identification). Product feature extraction is critical to sentiment analysis, because its effectiveness significantly affects the performance of opinion orientation identification, as well as the ultimate effectiveness of sentiment analysis. Therefore, this study concentrates on product feature extraction from consumer reviews. Specifically, we propose a semantic-based product feature extraction (SPE) technique that exploits a list of positive and negative adjectives defined in the General Inquirer to recognize opinion words semantically and subsequently extract product features expressed in consumer reviews. Using a prevalent product feature extraction technique and the SPE-GI technique (a variant of SPE) as performance benchmarks, our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed SPE technique outperforms both benchmark techniques. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Consumer review; Opinion summarization; Product feature extraction; Sentiment analysis; Text mining,,2-s2.0-74449092305

The second type holds a critique of certain parties either on the basis of their policies or their behaviour. It is these sentiments that are (omni)present, in different interlinked themes, in the literature of extreme-right parties. They serve, on the one hand, to help them to profit from the existing anti-party sentiments at the mass level and, on the other hand, to help them present themselves in a positive manner, by self-defining the party as the opposite of the other parties.

All countries in this study are represented with at least two observations over time, which allows us to control for unobserved country characteristics and/or policies that may influence smoking patterns within countries. Results Cigarette price is an important determinant of smoking. The estimated price elasticity of smoking participation is -0.74, and the estimated price elasticity of conditional cigarette demand is approximately -1.37. The total price elasticity of cigarette demand is -2.11, implying that an increase in price of 10% would reduce youth cigarette consumption by 21.1% at the mean.",,"adolescent; adult; article; child; child behavior; commercial phenomena; cost; developing country; economics; health survey; human; income; psychological aspect; smoking; smoking cessation; statistical model; statistics; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Child; Commerce; Costs and Cost Analysis; Developing Countries; Health Surveys; Humans; Income; Models, Econometric; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Young Adult",2-s2.0-80054923942

Analysis of processes of development, maintenance and redefinition of identity in contexts of alternative cultural norms contends with the assumption of conscious choice or strategy towards mainstream and heritage cultures. From the perspective of identity issues, enculturation of cultural elements rather than acculturation is often the more significant process. Going beyond critique to consider issues of the persistence of ethnic identity and processes of cultural reformulation, brings attention to the origins of primordialist sentiment within ethnic identity and the possibilities for generating situationalist perspectives. Reference to empirical investigations using Identity Structure Analysis (introduced as a conceptual framework for explicating complex identity processes) provides evidence for different identity processes and structures according to socio-historical context and the greater malleability of situationalists compared with primordialists in their empathetic identifications with alternative cultural groups. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Such tracking and analysis can provide critical information for decision making in various domains. Therefore it has attracted attention in both academia and industry. Previous research mainly focused on modeling and tracking public sentiment. In this work, we move one step further to interpret sentiment variations. We observed that emerging topics (named foreground topics) within the sentiment variation periods are highly related to the genuine reasons behind the variations. Based on this observation, we propose a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based model, Foreground and Background LDA (FB-LDA), to distill foreground topics and filter out longstanding background topics. These foreground topics can give potential interpretations of the sentiment variations. To further enhance the readability of the mined reasons, we select the most representative tweets for foreground topics and develop another generative model called Reason Candidate and Background LDA (RCB-LDA) to rank them with respect to their 'popularity' within the variation period. Experimental results show that our methods can effectively find foreground topics and rank reason candidates. The proposed models can also be applied to other tasks such as finding topic differences between two sets of documents.

Training sentiment classifiers from tweets data often faces the data sparsity problem partly due to the large variety of short and irregular forms introduced to tweets because of the 140-character limit. In this work we propose using two different sets of features to alleviate the data sparseness problem. One is the semantic feature set where we extract semantically hidden concepts from tweets and then incorporate them into classifier training through interpolation. Another is the sentiment-topic feature set where we extract latent topics and the associated topic sentiment from tweets, then augment the original feature space with these sentiment-topics. Experimental results on the Stanford Twitter Sentiment Dataset show that both feature sets outperform the baseline model using unigrams only. Moreover, using semantic features rivals the previously reported best result. Using sentimenttopic features achieves 86.3% sentiment classification accuracy, which outperforms existing approaches.

To test the validity of these metrics, we conduct an empirical study based on data from Amazon.com and BN.com (Barnes & Noble). The results demonstrate significant effects of our proposed measures on product sales. This effect is not fully captured by nontextual review measures such as numerical ratings. Furthermore, in capturing the sales effect of review content, our divergence metrics are shown to be superior to and more appropriate than some commonly used textual measures the literature. The findings provide important insights into the business impact of social media and user-generated content, an emerging problem in business intelligence research.

Traditional facet-based sentiment analysis algorithms typically perform the various tasks in sequence, and fail to take advantage of the mutual reinforcement of the tasks. Additionally, inferring sentiment levels typically requires domain knowledge or human intervention. In this paper, we propose a series of probabilistic models that jointly discover latent facets and sentiment topics, and also order the sentiment topics with respect to a multi-point scale, in a language and domain independent manner. This is achieved by simultaneously capturing both short-range syntactic structure and long range semantic dependencies between the sentiment and facet words. The models further incorporate coherence in reviews, where reviewers dwell on one facet or sentiment level before moving on, for more accurate facet and sentiment discovery. For reviews which are supplemented with ratings, our models automatically order the latent sentiment topics, without requiring seed-words or domain-knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to combine the notions of syntactic and semantic dependencies in the domain of review mining. Further, the concept of facet and sentiment coherence has not been explored earlier either. Extensive experimental results on real world review data show that the proposed models outperform various state of the art baselines for facet-based sentiment analysis.

The conflict culminated in ethnic cleansing along lines of religious identity, with approximately three hundred thousand people fleeing their homes. Based on detailed research, this book provides an in depth picture of all aspects of this devastating and brutal conflict. It also provides numerous examples of how different conflict theories can be applied in the analysis of real situations of tensions and violence, illustrating the mutually reinforcing nature of mass level sentiment and elite agency, and the rational and emotive influences on those involved.

The use of EDC systems should confer improved data integrity, cost savings and a shorter time to study database closure. This will reduce the time to market and cost of new medications. With the current sentiment of the industry suggesting the cost analysis has been accepted to be in favor of EDC, the likely limitation to disseminated use is an inability to implement these systems. If the leadership at the sponsor, clinical research organization and investigator site is cognizant of the barriers to implementation, they can anticipate and mitigate them prior to the users becoming disgruntled and resistant to the new method of data capture. Once understood, barriers such as user input, technical support, user motivation, regulatory requirements, communication with users, timing of implementation, software installation, graphical user interface, identification of bridgers, patient participation, availability of technology, and costs can be better addressed at the beginning of the implementation process and successfully averted.

In this paper we took the case of the terrorist event in Woolwich, London in 2013 and built models to predict information flow size and survival using data derived from the popular social networking site Twitter. We define information flows as the propagation over time of information posted to Twitter via the action of retweeting. Following a comparison with different predictive methods, and due to the distribution exhibited by our dependent size measure, we used the zero-truncated negative binomial (ZTNB) regression method. To model survival, the Cox regression technique was used because it estimates proportional hazard rates for independent measures. Following a principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data, social, temporal and content factors of the tweet were used as predictors in both models. Given the likely emotive reaction caused by the event, we emphasize the influence of emotive content on propagation in the discussion section. From a sample of Twitter data collected following the event (N = 427,330) we report novel findings that identify that the sentiment expressed in the tweet is statistically significantly predictive of both size and survival of information flows of this nature. Furthermore, the number of offline press reports relating to the event published on the day the tweet was posted was a significant predictor of size, as was the tension expressed in a tweet in relation to survival. Furthermore, time lags between retweets and the co-occurrence of URLS and hashtags also emerged as significant. © 2014, The Author(s).",Information flows; Information propagation; Information spreading; Opinion mining; Predictive models; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Social network analysis; Twitter,,2-s2.0-84906264962

However, the attitudinal drivers of support for the BNP and ERPs more generally remain under-researched. This article draws on unique data that allow unprecedented insight into the attitudinal profile of ERP voters in Britain - an often neglected case in the wider literature. A series of possible motivational drivers of extreme right support are separated out: racial prejudice, anti-immigrant sentiment, protest against political elites, Euroscepticism, homophobia and Islamophobia. It is found that BNP support in the 2009 EP elections was motivationally diverse, with racist hostility, xenophobia and protest voting all contributing significantly to BNP voting. The analysis suggests that the BNP, which has long been a party stigmatised by associations with racism and violent extremism, made a key breakthrough in 2009. While racist motivations remain the strongest driver of support for the party, it has also begun to win over a broader coalition of anti-immigrant and anti-elite voters. © 2010 The Author(s).

This article critiques the democratization literature's excessive focus on class actors and economic factors by highlighting the importance of emotive appeals to nationalist and religious sentiments and solidarities in sparking, sustaining, and sanctifying high-risk protest against authoritarian governments. A comparative historical analysis of seven Southeast Asian countries reveals that democratic uprisings are more likely both to emerge and to succeed when communal elites-a society's primary possessors of nationalist and religious authority-assume an oppositional posture.

While this is often expressed in the (re)iteration of a 'management matters' mantra, we see some disarray in the broader capacity literature both in definition and application. As scholars call for more integrated models of governance that link, for example, capacity and performance, we see a growing need for an analysis of the concept of capacity. Using bibliometric and content analyses to explore scholarly treatment of capacity constructs, this article assesses whether the perceived disarray is real, and if so what consequences it might have.We do so by reporting on capacity's meaning and measurement through an analysis of four decades of the private, public and nonprofit management literatures.

Method: In 2003, at a major midwestern U.S. teaching institution, 247 primary care residents were administered a questionnaire adapted from that used in the Religion and Spirituality in the Medical Encounter Study to assess whether primary care house officers feel they should discuss religious and spiritual issues with patients, pray with patients, or both, and whether personal characteristics of residents, including their own spiritual well-being, religiosity, and tendency to use spiritual and religious coping mechanisms, are related to their sentiments regarding spirituality and religion in health care. Simple descriptive, univariate, and two types of multivariable analyses were performed. Results: Data were collected from 227 residents (92%) in internal medicine, pediatrics, internal medicine/pediatrics, and family medicine. One hundred four (46%) respondents felt that they should play a role in patients' spiritual or religious lives. In multivariable analysis, this sentiment was associated with greater frequency of participating in organized religious activity (odds ratio [OR] 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.99), a higher level of personal spirituality (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08), and older resident age (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21; C-statistic 0.76). In general, advocating spiritual and religious involvement was most often associated with high personal levels of spiritual and religious coping and with the family medicine training program. Residents were more likely to agree with incorporating spirituality and religion into patient encounters as the gravity of the patient's condition increased (p < .0001). Conclusions: Approximately half of primary care residents felt that they should play a role in their patients' spiritual or religious lives.

The cohesion of each Bloc is based on different sentiments and interests. The Western Bloc can be viewed as a coalition based on historical and political interests. The Northern Bloc draws its solidarity from common cultural and primordial lingual codes (i.e. German). The diffuse Mediterranean Bloc probably achieves its unstable alliance from common cultural experiences. In contrast, the structural equivalence analysis - which focuses on taste as revealed by similar patterns of voting - portrays a more diffuse structure, interpreted as 'islands of taste'; these are dispersed in line with cultural and lingual cleavages.

New analytical techniques, such as sentiment analysis, may allow us to understand and use this information more effectively to improve the quality of health care. Objective: We attempted to use machine learning to understand patients' unstructured comments about their care. We used sentiment analysis techniques to categorize online free-text comments by patients as either positive or negative descriptions of their health care. We tried to automatically predict whether a patient would recommend a hospital, whether the hospital was clean, and whether they were treated with dignity from their free-text description, compared to the patient's own quantitative rating of their care. Methods: We applied machine learning techniques to all 6412 online comments about hospitals on the English National Health Service website in 2010 using Weka data-mining software. We also compared the results obtained from sentiment analysis with the paper-based national inpatient survey results at the hospital level using Spearman rank correlation for all 161 acute adult hospital trusts in England. Results: There was 81%, 84%, and 89% agreement between quantitative ratings of care and those derived from free-text comments using sentiment analysis for cleanliness, being treated with dignity, and overall recommendation of hospital respectively (kappa scores: .40-.74, P<.001 for all).

With the rapid growth of Web 2.0 applications, online environmental scanning provides top executives with unprecedented opportunities to tap into collective web intelligence to develop better insights about the sociocultural and political-economic factors that cross-border M&As face. Grounded in Porter's five forces model, one major contribution of our research is the design of a novel due diligence scorecard model that leverages collective web intelligence to enhance M&A decision making. Another important contribution of our work is the design and development of an adaptive business intelligence (BI) 2.0 system underpinned by an evolutionary learning approach, domain-specific sentiment analysis, and business relation mining to operationalize the aforementioned scorecard model for adaptive M&A decision support.

We show how this optimization can be effectively carried out with simple gradient-based methods and how hyperparameters can be cross-validated without demanding any labeled data from the target domain.

This paper addresses the mechanism of Content-based advertising (Contextual advertising), which refers to the assignment of relevant ads to a generic web page, e. g., a blog post. As blogs become a platform for expressing personal opinion, they naturally contain various kinds of expressions, including both facts and comments of both a positive and negative nature. Besides, in line with the major tenet of Web 2.0 (i.e., user-centric), we believe that the web-site owners would be willing to be in charge of the ads which are positively related to their contents. Hence, in this paper, we propose the utilization of sentiment detection to improve Web-based contextual advertising. The proposed sentiment-oriented contextual advertising (SOCA) framework aims to combine contextual advertising matching with sentiment analysis to select ads that are related to the positive (and neutral) aspects of a blog and rank them according to their relevance.

They have been taken up by a much larger segment of government and policy makers and have also even been appropriated by groups that one might least expect to do so, such as African American activists in cities like Milwaukee. In this article, we examine a growing phenomenon: the growth of seemingly conservative sentiments among some of the least powerful groups in this society. Perhaps the most significant organization to emerge has been the Black Alliance for Educational Options (BAEO). It has mobilized around, voucher advocacy for urban working-class communities of color. BAEO has attracted significant attention not just for its iconoclastic alignment with conservative educational reform, but also for accepting funding from far-Right foundations. This article analyzes the complexity of the discursive and sociopolitical space that BAEO occupies. The organization's awareness of its critics, allies, and the limited range of educational options within which low-income African American families must act belies the notion, put forward by some, that BAEO is simply a front organization for the educational Right. Nevertheless, BAEO's importance to the larger rightist project in education cannot be overstated. At the core of our analysis is a concern about what is at stake for all of us if a rightist educational agenda succeeds in redefining what and whose knowledge is of most worth and what our social and educational policies are meant to do. Yet, no matter what one's position is on the wisdom of BAEO's strategic actions, this case provides a crucial example of the politics of how social movements and alliances are formed and reformed out of the material and ideological conditions of daily life. A critical but sympathetic understanding of groups such as BAEO may enable us to avoid the essentialism and reductionism that enters into critical sociological work on the nature of ongoing struggles over educational reform. It can provide a more nuanced sense of social actors and the possibilities and limits of strategic alliances in a time of major conflicts over educational reform during a period of conservative modernization.",,,2-s2.0-27844540295

In North America, the urban field, the regional city and the city's countryside have been invoked to explain the resurgence of 'dying villages'. Others argue that evolving census definitions account for much rural 'growth'. Several of these hypotheses are complementary and 'rural renaissance' is the result of diverse and complex factors, many of which are place-specific. A case study of Wroxeter, Ontario illustrates the process by which a declining rural service center became a tourist-amenity community with renewed prosperity.

Thanks to the popularity of social networks, images become an convenient carrier for information diffusion among online users. To understand the diffusion patterns and different aspects of the social images, we need to interpret the images first. Similar to textual content, images also carry different levels of sentiment to their viewers. However, different from text, where sentiment analysis can use easily accessible semantic and context information, how to extract and interpret the sentiment of an image remains quite challenging. In this paper, we propose an image sentiment prediction framework, which leverages the mid-level attributes of an image to predict its sentiment. This makes the sentiment classification results more interpretable than directly using the low-level features of an image. To obtain a better performance on images containing faces, we introduce eigenface-based facial expression detection as an additional mid-level attributes. An empirical study of the proposed framework shows improved performance in terms of prediction accuracy. More importantly, by inspecting the prediction results, we are able to discover interesting relationships between mid-level attribute and image sentiment.",Analysis; Image sentiment; Mid-level attributes; Visual content,Forecasting; Semantics; Social networking (online); Analysis; Facial expression detections; Image sentiment; Information diffusion; Mid-level attributes; Prediction accuracy; Sentiment classification; Visual content; Data mining,2-s2.0-84890625162

Despite this still-popular sentiment, the Basel Accords, a set of international standards for banking supervision and regulation, have been the subject of remarkably little public criticism. While academics and practitioners decry the enforcement of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on accounting reform or attempts by Congress to regulate executive compensation, the Basel Accords have been quietly accepted. In one of the first studies critically to examine the Basel Accords, Engineering the Financial Crisis reveals the crucial role that bank capital requirements and other government regulations played in the recent financial crisis. Jeffrey Friedman and Wladimir Kraus argue that by encouraging banks to invest in highly rated mortgage-backed bonds, the Basel Accords created an overconcentration of risk in the banking industry. In addition, accounting regulations required banks to reduce lending if the temporary market value of these bonds declined, as they did in 2007 and 2008 during the panic over subprime mortgage defaults. The book begins by assessing leading theories about the crisis-deregulation, bank compensation practices, excessive leverage, ""too big to fail,"" and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac-and, through careful evidentiary scrutiny, debunks much of the conventional wisdom about what went wrong. It then discusses the Basel Accords and how they contributed to systemic risk. Finally, it presents an analysis of social-science expertise and the fallibility of economists and regulators. Engagingly written, theoretically inventive, yet empirically grounded, Engineering the Financial Crisis is a timely examination of the unintended-and sometimes disastrous-effects of regulation on complex economies.

The extracted features are then compared and analyzed. To demonstrate generality, we use two authoritative Chinese data sets in different domains to conduct our experiments. Our statistical analysis of the experimental results indicate the following: (1) different types of features possess different discriminative capabilities in Chinese sentiment classification; (2) character bigram features perform the best among the Ngram features; (3) substring-group features have greater potential to improve the performance of sentiment classification by combining substrings of different lengths; (4) sentiment words or phrases extracted from existing sentiment lexicons are not effective for sentiment classification; (5) effective features are usually at varying lengths rather than fixed lengths. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Sentiment classification; Substring features; Substring-group; Suffix tree,Data sets; Different domains; Sentiment classification; Statistical analysis; Sub-strings; Substring; Substring features; Suffix tree; Text classification; Feature extraction; Text processing; Classification (of information),2-s2.0-79953685159

PREF applies existing linguistic processing techniques to extract opinion words and product features from reviews. It then estimates the sentimental orientations (SO) and strength of the opinion words using our proposed relative-frequency-based method. This method allows semantically similar words to have different SO, thereby addresses a major limitation of existing methods. PREF takes the intuitive relationships between class labels, which are scalar ratings, into consideration when assigning ratings to reviews. Empirical results validated the effectiveness of PREF against several related algorithms, and suggest that PREF can produce reasonably good results using a small training corpus. We also describe a useful application of PREF as a rating inference framework. Rating inference transforms user preferences described as natural language texts into numerical rating scales. This allows Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms, which operate mostly on databases of scalar ratings, to utilize textual reviews as an additional source of user preferences. We integrated PREF with a classical CF algorithm, and empirically demonstrated the advantages of using rating inference to augment ratings for CF. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",collaborative filtering; recommender systems; sentiment analysis; text mining,Class labels; Collaborative filtering; Empirical results; Existing method; Linguistic processing; Natural language text; Numerical rating scale; Product feature; Sentiment analysis; Small training; text mining; Algorithms; Data mining; Natural language processing systems; Rating; Recommender systems; Inference engines,2-s2.0-79952253071

Such a sentiment sits uncomfortably with a large number of empirical studies suggesting that the process of determining executive pay seems to be more readily explained by recourse to arguments of managerial power and influence. This article investigates the micro-underpinnings of boardroom behavior in order to explain this departure from principal-agency theory's argument that executive compensation serves to align interests between the owners of the company and its senior managers. We find that there are strong interaction effects among social influence variables and the social setting of boardroom activity. Generous pay awards, bearing only a weak connection to corporate performance, are explained in the context of the social psychology of the boardroom. These results and a review of the empirical research, suggest the need for a more comprehensive model of executive compensation that incorporates both economic and psychological determinants. © The Author 2010.

Japanese banks had been severely weakened by the collapse of the real estate and stock market bubble in Japan in 1990. As the largest lenders in Asia and the key creditor in Thailand, Japanese banks signalled the change in sentiment to other foreign commercial banks who also withdrew their loans. These capital outflows triggered a devaluation in Thailand in mid-1997, but not in Korea until late 1997, due to the different exchange rate regimes in these countries. Despite the devaluation and outflow of bank loans, bond investors continued to provide capital to Asian borrowers until November 1997, at spreads which did not reflect the risks involved. By 1998, foreign equity investors were returning to these markets in search of bargains. Rather than rushing to the exits in a herd-like fashion, institutional investors made investment decisions which created off-setting private capital flows. This analysis suggests that more attention should be paid to the incentives facing institutional investors and the design of domestic institutions, rather than to the need for a new financial architecture.",Asian currency crisis; Capital flows; Commercial banks; Institutional investors; International finance; Japan,,2-s2.0-0035622606

Researchers have largely relied on textual sentiment analysis to develop systems to predict political elections, measure economic indicators, and so on. Recently, social media users are increasingly using images and videos to express their opinions and share their experiences. Sentiment analysis of such large scale visual content can help better extract user sentiments toward events or topics, such as those in image tweets, so that prediction of sentiment from visual content is complementary to textual sentiment analysis. Motivated by the needs in leveraging large scale yet noisy training data to solve the extremely challenging problem of image sentiment analysis, we employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We first design a suitable CNN architecture for image sentiment analysis. We obtain half a million training samples by using a baseline sentiment algorithm to label Flickr images. To make use of such noisy machine labeled data, we employ a progressive strategy to fine-tune the deep network. Furthermore, we improve the performance on Twitter images by inducing domain transfer with a small number of manually labeled Twitter images. We have conducted extensive experiments on manually labeled Twitter images. The results show that the proposed CNN can achieve better performance in image sentiment analysis than competing algorithms.

This is contextually different from traditional topic based text classification since it involves classifying opinionated text according to the sentiment conveyed by it. Feature selection is a critical task in sentiment analysis and effectively selected representative features from subjective text can improve sentiment based classification. This paper explores the applicability of five commonly used feature selection methods in data mining research (DF, IG, GR, CHI and Relief-F) and seven machine learning based classification techniques (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Maximum Entropy, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Winnow, Adaboost) for sentiment analysis on online movie reviews dataset. The paper demonstrates that feature selection does improve the performance of sentiment based classification, but it depends on the method adopted and the number of feature selected. The experimental results presented in this paper show that Gain Ratio gives the best performance for sentimental feature selection, and SVM performs better than other techniques for sentiment based classification.

A new generation of short and easy-to-use tools to monitor patient outcomes on a regular basis has been recently proposed. These tools are quick, effective and easy to understand, as they are very structured and rigid. Such structuredness, however, leaves no space to those patients who would like to say something more. Patients, in fact, are usually willing to express their opinions and feelings in free text, rather than simply filling in a questionnaire, for either speaking out their satisfaction or for cathartic complaining. Sentic PROMs allow patients to evaluate their health status and experience in a semi-structured way and accordingly aggregate input data by means of sentic computing, while tracking patients' physio-emotional sensitivity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Accurate identification of aliases of a given person name is useful in various web related tasks such as information retrieval, sentiment analysis, personal name disambiguation, and relation extraction. We propose a method to extract aliases of a given personal name from the web. Given a personal name, the proposed method first extracts a set of candidate aliases. Second, we rank the extracted candidates according to the likelihood of a candidate being a correct alias of the given name. We propose a novel, automatically extracted lexical pattern-based approach to efficiently extract a large set of candidate aliases from snippets retrieved from a web search engine. We define numerous ranking scores to evaluate candidate aliases using three approaches: lexical pattern frequency, word co-occurrences in an anchor text graph, and page counts on the web. To construct a robust alias detection system, we integrate the different ranking scores into a single ranking function using ranking support vector machines. We evaluate the proposed method on three data sets: an English personal names data set, an English place names data set, and a Japanese personal names data set. The proposed method outperforms numerous baselines and previously proposed name alias extraction methods, achieving a statistically significant mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 0.67. Experiments carried out using location names and Japanese personal names suggest the possibility of extending the proposed method to extract aliases for different types of named entities, and for different languages. Moreover, the aliases extracted using the proposed method are successfully utilized in an information retrieval task and improve recall by 20 percent in a relation-detection task. © 2011 IEEE.",information extraction; Web mining; web text analysis.,Alias detection; Automatic discovery; Data sets; Detection tasks; Extraction method; Information Extraction; Lexical patterns; Mean reciprocal ranks; Named entities; Personal name disambiguation; Personal names; Ranking functions; Relation extraction; Sentiment analysis; Web mining; Web search engines; web text analysis.; Natural language processing systems; Search engines; Websites; Information retrieval,2-s2.0-79955524576

This programme investigated the effect of taking people with dementia to discuss artworks at the National Gallery of Australia (NGA). Method: Fifteen people from the community and eight from residential care attended the gallery once a week for 6 weeks. They discussed artworks with NGA Educators trained in dementia skills. Sessions were filmed and the level of engagement analysed using time sampling methods. Focus groups with participants, carers, and educators provided qualitative data. Results: Participants were engaged from the outset and remained engaged. They became animated, gained confidence and were able to discuss and interact with the artworks and the social process. This included the more impaired RACF groups, who were more withdrawn or behaviourally disturbed in their usual environment, raising the concept of excess disability. In focus groups these participants had impoverished memory for the programme but community participants remembered it with pleasure and wanted it to continue. Carers confirmed these sentiments but reported no lasting change in participants. Educators spoke mostly about what they had learned, including new ways to present to other clients. Conclusion: The programme went beyond many dementia activities. Despite no evidence for lasting effects, all involved wanted the programme to continue. A carer quote: You do it for the moment encapsulates a sense that an activity is worthwhile even if it gives benefit only whilst running.

The purpose of this study was to examine long-term trajectories of visits to nursing homes by family caregivers to persons suffering from dementia. Methods. The data were obtained from a 5-year longitudinal study of family caregiving. This analysis used a subsample of caregivers who moved their relatives from home to a nursing home (n = 210). The frequency (times per week) and length (hours per week) of visits for up to 5 years after placement were examined in relation to select caregiver and care-recipient characteristics. A semiparametric, group-based method using a latent class mixture model was used to identify distinctive trajectories over time. Results. The majority of caregivers maintained the frequency and length of their visits for extended periods of time. Five distinct patterns for frequency and three patterns for length were identified. Being a spouse, lower education, a close past relationship, a strong sentiment against placement, and living close to the facility predicted membership in groups visiting frequently and for longer times. Caregiver characteristics were more strongly associated with frequency, whereas care-recipient characteristics were related to length. Discussion. To a large extent, family visits to nursing home residents with dementia become established in the period immediately after relocation, which means that efforts to enhance continued family involvement should commence at the time of admission.",,"aged; Alzheimer disease; article; dementia; family; female; geriatric care; geriatric patient; human; long term care; major clinical study; male; nursing home; priority journal; residential care; spouse; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Caregivers; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Geriatric Assessment; Homes for the Aged; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nursing Homes; Patient Admission; Social Support; Socioeconomic Factors; Visitors to Patients",2-s2.0-0036300710

Data were obtained through administration of a sexual behavior questionnaire, personal interviews and review of medical records. Statistically significant changes were found: decreased frequency of masturbation and intercourse, decreased frequency of orgasm through non-coital sexual activities, less satisfaction with sex, and less enjoyment of intercourse. The majority believed that changes were due to radiation therapy and reflected decreased feelings of self-esteem, sex desirability and attractiveness. Most of the women believed that cancer could be transmitted through intercourse. Women who did not follow advice regarding use of vaginal dilators and did not resume their pre-illness level of sex were more likely to develop physical and sexual changes. The subjects' need for sexual counselling concerning the effect of the illness and treatment on relationships with partners was strongly evident. Suggestions for preventing undesirable physical and psychological changes, and guidelines for counselling are provided. Zusammenfassung Einundzwanzig Frauen mit Zervixkarzinom Typ I und II, die mit einer Strahlentherapie behandelt worden waren, wurden zur Identifizierung von Veränderungen in ihrem Sexualverhalten durch einen Vergleich ihres Verhaltens vor der Erkrankung und nach der Therapie evaluiert; und dazu befragt, ob sie gegebenenfalls die Verhaltensänderung auf die Therapie zurückführen oder ob andere Faktoren mit einer möglichen sexuellen Dysfunktion in Verbindung stehen. Die Daten wurden durch die Auswertung eines Fragebogens zum Sexualverhalten, persönliche Befragung und Überprüfung der medizinischen Befunde erhalten. Es wurden Veränderungen von statischer Bedeutung festgestellt: verminderte Häufigkeit von Masturbation und Geschlechtsverkehr, verminderte Orgasmushäufigkeit durch nicht-koitale sexuelle Betätigung, geringere Befriedigung durch Sex und verminderter Genuß beim Geschlechtsverkehr. Die Mehrheit glaubte, diese Veränderungen seien auf die Strahlentherapie zurückzuführen und reflektierten vermindertes Selbstwertgefühl, sexuelle Anziehungskraft und Attraktivität. Die meisten Frauen dachten, die Krebskrankheit könne durch den Geschlechtsverkehr übertragen werden. Bei Frauen, die die Ratschläge in bezug auf die Verwendung von Vaginaldilatoren nicht befolgten und deren sexuelle Aktivität nicht wieder auf das Maß vor der Krankheit anstieg, stellten sich häufiger physische und sexuelle Veränderungen ein. Der Bedarf der Patientinnen an Sexualberatung in bezug auf die Auswirkungen der Erkrankung und Behandlung auf die Beziehung zum Partner wurde überaus deutlich. Vorschläge dazu, wie die unerwünschten physischen und psychischen Veränderungen verhindert werden können und Richtlinien für die Beratung werden angeboten. Résumé Vingt-et-une femmes souffrant de cancer de l'utérus de Types 1 et 2, traitées par radiothérapie, ont été évaluées par comparaison de périodes avant le cancer et après les traitement, pour identifier des changements de comportement sexuel et, dans l'affirmative, pour savoir si elles attribuaient ces changements au traitement ou si d'autres facteurs étaient impliqués dans leur dysfonctionnement ou non-dysfonctionnement sexuel. Des données ont été obtenues par l'intermédiaire d'un questionnaire sur le comportement sexuel, d'interviews personnelles et d'examen des dossiers médicaux. L'on a constaté des changements significatifs au point de vue statistique: fréquence réduite de la masturbation et des rapports sexuels, fréquence réduite de l'orgasme par activité sexuelle non associée au coït, satisfaction sexuelle réduite et moins de plaisir dans les rapports sexuels. La majorité des femmes pensaient que ces changements étaient dus à la radiothérapie et reflétaient des sentiments de dévalorisation et de réduction de leur attrait sexuel et physique. La plupart des femmes pensaient que le cancer pouvait être transmis par l'intermédiaire de relations sexuelles. Celles qui n'avaient pas suivi les conseils associés à l'utilisation de dilatateurs vaginaux et qui n'avaient pas atteint le niveau d'activité sexuelle qui avait précédé leur maladie étaient plus sujettes aux modifications physiques et sexuelles. Les sujets ont démontré un besoin évident de conseils sexuels concernant l'effet de la maladie et du traitement sur leurs rapports avec leurs partenaires.

Regularities of economic attitudes and behavior are demonstrated on the aggregative (i.e., macro) level, whereas individual attitudes and behavior are shown to fluctuate to a much greater extent and to be subject to considerable noise. Using analyses of (a) uncertainty and (b) of the learning process by masses of people, this article shows that a study of macroprocesses may usefully supplement the usual microanalysis. Forecasting is much more successful on the macro than on the micro level. Both short-term and middle-range predictions of American economic trends are made possible by collecting data on the attitudes and expectations of representative samples, primarily on the extent of their optimism and confidence or pessimism and uncertainty. A strong positive relation between attitudes and behavior is indicated at the macro but not micro level.

Experimental evidence from the laboratory is slight and partly inconsistent; problems of definition and measurement obscure analysis in the field. A prevailing view, however, associates high population density with indexes of social and psychological malaise. This article reviews this position in the light of seminal comparative and social experimentation. While it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from the existing meager body of data, the balance of evidence appears not to support any simple causal relationship between density and socio- or psychopathology. Dire prognoses of the horrors of 'overcrowding' are judged to be imprecise and premature. Recent research has tended to distinguish between density and crowding, referring to the former in terms of sociospatial factors, and to the latter in terms of individual perception. It is suggested that any theory of crowding should encompass the intrapsychic case and that research should attempt to uncover evidence, if any, of neurophysiological responses to sociospatial variations in density.",,behavior; major clinical study; normal human; psychiatry; sociology,2-s2.0-0016274681

We used a 7-layer deep convolutional neural network to tag each word in opinionated sentences as either aspect or non-aspect word. We also developed a set of linguistic patterns for the same purpose and combined them with the neural network.

The result is encouraging in that the accuracy of NBC is improved and approaches 82% when the dataset size increases. We have demonstrated that NBC is able to scale up to analyze the sentiment of millions movie reviews with increasing throughput. © 2013 IEEE.",Big data; Cloud computing; Polarity mining; sentiment classification,Analyzing system; Bayes Classifier; Big datum; Fine-grain controls; Machine learning technology; Sentiment classification; Standard libraries; Training dataset; Cloud computing,2-s2.0-84893237676

Social media is generating a vast amount of sentiment rich data in the form of tweets, status updates, blog posts etc. Sentiment analysis of this user generated data is very useful in knowing the opinion of the crowd. Twitter sentiment analysis is difficult compared to general sentiment analysis due to the presence of slang words and misspellings. The maximum limit of characters that are allowed in Twitter is 140. Knowledge base approach and Machine learning approach are the two strategies used for analyzing sentiments from the text. In this paper, we try to analyze the twitter posts about electronic products like mobiles, laptops etc using Machine Learning approach. By doing sentiment analysis in a specific domain, it is possible to identify the effect of domain information in sentiment classification. We present a new feature vector for classifying the tweets as positive, negative and extract peoples' opinion about products. © 2013 IEEE.",Machine Learning Techniques; Sentiment Analysis; Twitter,,2-s2.0-84894446627

However, understanding the multiple 'aspects' that contribute to users' ratings may help us to better understand their individual preferences. For example, a user's impression of an audiobook presumably depends on aspects such as the story and the narrator, and knowing their opinions on these aspects may help us to recommend better products. In this paper, we build models for rating systems in which such dimensions are explicit, in the sense that users leave separate ratings for each aspect of a product. By introducing new corpora consisting of five million reviews, rated with between three and six aspects, we evaluate our models on three prediction tasks: First, we uncover which parts of a review discuss which of the rated aspects. Second, we summarize reviews by finding the sentences that best explain a user's rating. Finally, since aspect ratings are optional in many of the datasets we consider, we recover ratings that are missing from a user's evaluation. Our model matches state-of-the-art approaches on existing small-scale datasets, while scaling to the real-world datasets we introduce. Moreover, our model is able to 'disentangle' content and sentiment words: we automatically learn content words that are indicative of a particular aspect as well as the aspect-specific sentiment words that are indicative of a particular rating. © 2012 IEEE.",Machine learning; Segmentation; Sentiment analysis; Summarization,Individual preference; Learning attitudes; Online reviews; Prediction tasks; Rating system; Real-world datasets; Sentiment analysis; State-of-the-art approach; Summarization; Data mining; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Rating,2-s2.0-84874056378

Within this broad field, most of the work has been focused on either Sentiment Polarity classification, where a text is classified as having positive or negative sentiment, or Subjectivity classification, in which a text is classified as being subjective or objective. However, in this paper, we consider instead a real-world problem in which the attitude of the author is characterised by three different (but related) target variables: Subjectivity, Sentiment Polarity, Will to Influence, unlike the two previously stated problems, where there is only a single variable to be predicted. For that reason, the (uni-dimensional) common approaches used in this area yield to suboptimal solutions to this problem. Somewhat similar happens with multi-label learning techniques which cannot directly tackle this problem. In order to bridge this gap, we propose, for the first time, the use of the novel multi-dimensional classification paradigm in the Sentiment Analysis domain. This methodology is able to join the different target variables in the same classification task so as to take advantage of the potential statistical relations between them. In addition, and in order to take advantage of the huge amount of unlabelled information available nowadays in this context, we propose the extension of the multi-dimensional classification framework to the semi-supervised domain. Experimental results for this problem show that our semi-supervised multi-dimensional approach outperforms the most common Sentiment Analysis approaches, concluding that our approach is beneficial to improve the recognition rates for this problem, and in extension, could be considered to solve future Sentiment Analysis problems. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..",EM algorithm; Multi-dimensional class Bayesian network classifiers; Multi-dimensional classification; Semi-supervised learning; Sentiment Analysis,Bayesian network classifiers; Classification framework; Classification tasks; Computational studies; EM algorithms; Learning techniques; Multi-dimensional approach; Multi-label; Negative sentiments; Polarity classification; Real-world problem; Recognition rates; Semi-supervised; Semi-supervised learning; Sentiment analysis; Single variable; Statistical relations; Suboptimal solution; Algorithms; Bayesian networks; Data mining; Supervised learning; Text processing; article; Bayes theorem; Bayesian network classifier; classification; classifier; data mining; learning algorithm; machine learning; mathematical computing; priority journal; semi supervised learning; sentiment analysis,2-s2.0-84861480960

Understanding the emotional impacts of participation on patients and their informal caregivers is important for OHC managers. Ethnographical observations, interviews, and questionnaires have reported benefits from online health communities, but these approaches are too costly to adopt for large-scale analyses of emotional impacts. A computational approach using machine learning and text mining techniques is demonstrated using data from the American Cancer Society Cancer Survivors Network (CSN), an online forum of nearly a half million posts. This approach automatically estimates the sentiment of forum posts, discovers sentiment change patterns in CSN members, and allows investigation of factors that affect the sentiment change. This first study of sentiment benefits and dynamics in a large-scale health-related electronic community finds that an estimated 75%-85% of CSN forum participants change their sentiment in a positive direction through online interactions with other community members. Two new features, Name and Slang, not previously used in sentiment analysis, facilitate identifying positive sentiment in posts. This work establishes foundational concepts for further studies of sentiment impact of OHC participation and provides insight useful for the design of new OHC's or enhancement of existing OHCs in providing better emotional support to their members. © 2011 IEEE.",,American Cancer Society; Change patterns; Computational approach; Large-scale analysis; Online forums; Online interaction; Online support; Sentiment analysis; Social support; Text mining techniques; Data mining; Diseases; Dynamics; Health; Surveys; Health risks,2-s2.0-84856163855

This notion is fundamentally flawed as the concept of a perfect market has limited applicability to the real world context in which property investment decisions are taken. Investment decision-making is neither clinical nor methodical but is undertaken by imperfect players in imperfect markets using imperfect information. The purpose of this paper is to explore the decision making processes of investors. Design/methodology/approach - A normative-behavioural framework incorporating heuristics is used, a technique whose application in property research has previously been limited to valuation. The empirical vehicle for the research was an exploration of the spatial dimension of office property investment in different European contexts. Findings - The findings of in-depth case studies of investment decision-making in France, Germany and the UK indicate that the decision-making process, as perceived by institutional investors, does not deviate significantly from normative models. However, investors tend to ""collapse down"" the decision-making process, taking shortcuts to achieve (in some cases, predefined) investment outcomes. These short-cuts potentially leave the decision-making process open to the influence of bias, judgement and sentiment.

Although Bourdieu argues against such reductionism in his methodological pronouncements, his empirical studies tend to reduce actors' putative disinterested judgements to functions of their habitus in relation to the social field and to unconscious strategies of distinction. Further, his concept of (non-monetary) forms of capital occludes the difference between use-value and exchange-value and the corresponding distinction between the pursuit of goods and the pursuit of distinction, which are vital for both explanation and critique. Moreover his suspicion of normative judgement on the part of social science and his concealment of his own normative standpoint subvert his critiques. Thus in relation to Bourdieu's analysis of the role of misrecognition in social life I argue that this requires a delineation of the extent of justified recognition. In developing the argument I draw upon Adam Smith's analysis of moral sentiments and his critique of undeserved recognition and the pursuit of distinction. Where Bourdieu is dismissive about moral issues, Smith treats moral sentiments as irreducible to interest or instrumental action and as a significant element in the reproduction of social order. The paper concludes with some implications for the nature of critique in socia theory.",,,2-s2.0-0033177151

To achieve a competitive advantage, it is often necessary to listen to and understand what customers are saying about competitors' products and services. Current social media analytics frameworks do not provide benchmarks that allow businesses to compare customer sentiment on social media to easily understand where businesses are doing well and where they need to improve. In this paper, we present a social media competitive analytics framework with sentiment benchmarks that can be used to glean industry-specific marketing intelligence. Based on the idea of the proposed framework, new social media competitive analytics with sentiment benchmarks can be developed to enhance marketing intelligence and to identify specific actionable areas in which businesses are leading and lagging to further improve their customers' experience using customer opinions gleaned from social media. Guided by the proposed framework, an innovative business-driven social media competitive analytics tool named VOZIQ is developed.

In Study 1, 368 participants from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, completed a novel measure of belief in a Jewish conspiracy theory, along with measures of general conspiracist ideation, and anomie. Initial analysis showed that the novel scale factorially reduced to a single dimension. Further analysis showed that belief in the Jewish conspiracy theory was only significantly associated with gen-eral conspiracist ideation, but the strength of the association was weak. In Study 2, 314 participants completed the measure of belief in the Jewish conspiracy theory, along with measures of general conspiracist ideation, and ideological attitudes. Results showed that belief in the Jewish conspiracy theory was associated with anti-Israeli attitudes, modern racism directed at the Chinese, right-wing authoritarianism, and social dominance orien-tation. General conspiracist ideation did not emerge as a significant predictor once other variables had been accounted for.These results suggest that there may be specific cultural and social psychological forces that drive belief in the Jewish conspiracy theory within the Malaysian context. Specifically, belief in the Jewish conspiracy theory among Malaysian Malays appears to serve ideological needs and as a mask for anti-Chinese sentiment, which may in turn reaffirm their perceived ability to shape socio-political processes. © 2012 Swami.",Anti-semitism; Conspiracy theories; Malaysia; Modern racism; Monological belief system,,2-s2.0-84867127381

Spiritual Transcendence is nondenominational in nature and hypothesized to underlie the development of religious sentiments. To further support the universal nature of Spiritual Transcendence, the STS was translated into a native Filipino language, Tagalog. Using two different, varied samples of Filipino adults (N = 654 and 248, respectively), this study demonstrated that scores on the translated version evidenced acceptable levels of internal consistency, structural validity, and incremental validity over personality in predicting a wide range of psychosocial outcomes, like well-being and interpersonal style. Further analyses also indicated that the Tagalog version of the STS produced comparable means and standard deviations to its English counterpart. The data provided support for the hypothesis that spirituality is a robust, universal human quality because two languages that are etymologically distinct both include terms that describe transcendent experiences. The STS appears to be an empirically robust measure of these qualities that can be useful for researchers interested in establishing cross-cultural linkages in spiritual motivation.",,adolescent; adult; affect; aged; article; controlled study; cultural anthropology; female; human; internal consistency; linguistics; male; motivation; personality; Philippines; psychological rating scale; psychological well being; religion; scoring system; social psychology; Spiritual Transcendence Scale; validity,2-s2.0-34547443302

A possible source of heterogeneity-aggregation bias is identified raising question surrounding past inferences made in aggregate suicide research. The data and empirical method support a mounting sentiment of an abiding ecological fallacy in the suicide literature.

Drawing on data from a longitudinal study of infant and family development, groups were formed on the basis of attachment security at one year and compared in terms of patterns of marital change displayed by mothers and fathers. Mothers of insecure infants experienced significantly greater declines in positive marital activities and sentiments and greater increases in negative marital activities and sentiments than did mothers of secure one-year-olds, and this difference emerged between three and nine months postpartum. Even before babies were born, mothers of secure and insecure infants differed in their marital appraisal. Specifically, mothers of secure infants tended to base their prenatal marital satisfaction appraisals more on positive than negative aspects of the marriage whereas the reverse was true of mothers of insecure infants. No relationship between marital change and attachment was discerned for husbands. © 1985, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

In the past two years, over ten billion emojis were used on Twitter. Emojis are Unicode graphic symbols, used as a shorthand to express concepts and ideas. In contrast to the small number of well-known emoticons that carry clear emotional contents, there are hundreds of emojis. But what are their emotional contents? We provide the first emoji sentiment lexicon, called the Emoji Sentiment Ranking, and draw a sentiment map of the 751 most frequently used emojis. The sentiment of the emojis is computed from the sentiment of the tweets in which they occur. We engaged 83 human annotators to label over 1.6 million tweets in 13 European languages by the sentiment polarity (negative, neutral, or positive). About 4% of the annotated tweets contain emojis. The sentiment analysis of the emojis allows us to draw several interesting conclusions. It turns out that most of the emojis are positive, especially the most popular ones. The sentiment distribution of the tweets with and without emojis is significantly different. The inter-Annotator agreement on the tweets with emojis is higher. Emojis tend to occur at the end of the tweets, and their sentiment polarity increases with the distance. We observe no significant differences in the emoji rankings between the 13 languages and the Emoji Sentiment Ranking. Consequently, we propose our Emoji Sentiment Ranking as a European languageindependent resource for automated sentiment analysis. Finally, the paper provides a formalization of sentiment and a novel visualization in the form of a sentiment bar. © 2015 Kralj Novak et al.

In this paper, we focus on this fundamental issue of the sentiment analysis task. Specifically, we employ concepts as features and present a concept extraction algorithm based on a novel concept parser scheme to extract semantic features that exploit semantic relationships between words in natural language text. Additional conceptual information of a concept is obtained using the ConceptNet ontology: Concepts extracted from text are sent as queries to ConceptNet to extract their semantics. We select important concepts and eliminate redundant concepts using the Minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance feature selection technique. All selected concepts are then used to build a machine learning model that classifies a given document as positive or negative. We evaluate our concept extraction approach using a benchmark movie review dataset provided by Cornell University and product review datasets on books, DVDs, and electronics.

Applying state-of-the-art social analytics methodology to analyze the sentiments embedded in these consumer comments facilitates both firms' product design strategies and individual consumers' comparison shopping. However, existing social analytics methods often adopt coarse-grained and context-free sentiment analysis approaches. Consequently, these methods may not be effective enough to support firms and consumers' demands of fine-grained extraction of market intelligence from social media. Guided by the design science research methodology, the main contribution of our research is the design of a novel social analytics methodology that can leverage the sheer volume of consumer reviews archived at social media sites to perform a fine-grained extraction of market intelligence. More specifically, the proposed social analytics methodology is underpinned by a novel semi-supervised fuzzy product ontology mining algorithm. Evaluated based on real-world social media data, our prototype system shows remarkable performance improvement over a baseline ontology learning system and a context-free sentiment analysis system. The managerial implication of our research is that firms can apply the proposed social analytics methodology to tap into the collective social intelligence on the Web, and hence improve their product design and marketing strategies. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

As the number of reviews expands, it is essential to develop an efficient sentiment analysis model that is capable of extracting product aspects and determining the sentiments for these aspects. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised and domain-independent model for detecting explicit and implicit aspects in reviews for sentiment analysis. In the model, first a generalized method is proposed to learn multi-word aspects and then a set of heuristic rules is employed to take into account the influence of an opinion word on detecting the aspect. Second a new metric based on mutual information and aspect frequency is proposed to score aspects with a new bootstrapping iterative algorithm. The presented bootstrapping algorithm works with an unsupervised seed set. Third, two pruning methods based on the relations between aspects in reviews are presented to remove incorrect aspects. Finally the model employs an approach which uses explicit aspects and opinion words to identify implicit aspects. Utilizing extracted polarity lexicon, the approach maps each opinion word in the lexicon to the set of pre-extracted explicit aspects with a co-occurrence metric. The proposed model was evaluated on a collection of English product review datasets. The model does not require any labeled training data and it can be easily applied to other languages or other domains such as movie reviews. Experimental results show considerable improvements of our model over conventional techniques including unsupervised and supervised approaches. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

On average, Black segregation and isolation have fallen steadily but still remain very high in many areas, particularly those areas historically characterized by hypersegregation. In contrast, Hispanic segregation has increased slightly but Hispanic isolation has risen substantially owing to rapid population growth. Asian segregation has changed little and remains moderate, and although Asian isolation has increased it remains at low levels compared with other groups. Whites remain quite isolated from all three minority groups in metropolitan America, despite rising diversity and some shifts toward integration from the minority viewpoint. Multivariate analyses reveal that minority segregation and spatial isolation are actively produced in some areas by restrictive density zoning regimes, large and/or rising minority percentages, lagging minority socioeconomic status, and active expressions of anti-Black and anti-Latino sentiment, especially in large metropolitan areas. Areas displaying these characteristics are either integrating very slowly (in the case of Blacks) or becoming more segregated (in the case of Hispanics), whereas those lacking these attributes are clearly moving toward integration, often quite rapidly. © Hutchins Center for African and African American Research 2014.",African Americans; Discrimination; Land Use Zoning; Latinos; Segregation,,2-s2.0-84919646011

Consequently, automatic analysis techniques are needed to extract the opinions expressed in users' comments, given that these opinions are an implicit barometer of unquestionable interest for a wide variety of companies, agencies, and organisms. We thus propose a lexicon-based Comments-oriented News Sentiment Analyzer (LCN-SA), which is able to deal with the following: (a) the tendency of many users to express their views in non-standard language; (b) the detection of the target of users' opinions in a multi-domain scenario; (c) the design of a linguistic modularized knowledge model with low-cost adaptability. The system proposed consists of an automatic Focus Detection Module and a Sentiment Analysis Module capable of assessing user opinions of topics in news items.

We find that managers' propensity to disclose an adjusted earnings metric (especially one that exceeds the GAAP earnings number) increases with the level of investor sentiment. Furthermore, our analyses suggest that, as investor sentiment increases, managers: (1) exclude higher levels of both recurring and nonrecurring expenses in calculating the pro forma earnings number and (2) emphasize the pro forma figure by placing it more prominently within the earnings press release. Additional analyses indicate that the association between investor sentiment and managers' pro forma disclosure decisions at least partly reflects opportunistic motives.

This is especially true when consumers wish to compare two products, both of which are not negative. Previous work has addressed this problem by extracting various features from the review text for learning a predictor. Since the same word may have different sentiment effects when used by different reviewers on different products, we argue that it is necessary to model such reviewer and product dependent effects in order to predict review ratings more accurately. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework to incorporate reviewer and product information into the text based learner for rating prediction. The reviewer, product and text features are modeled as a three-dimension tensor. Tensor factorization techniques can then be employed to reduce the data sparsity problems.

However, the last decade's research results show that the task cannot be solved to complete satisfaction, especially when it comes to real life speech data and in particular to the assessment of speakers' valence. This paper therefore investigates novel approaches to the additional exploitation of linguistic information. To ensure good applicability to the real world, spontaneous speech and nonacted nonprototypical emotions are examined in the recently popular dimensional model in 3D continuous space. As there is a lack of linguistic analysis approaches and experiments for this model, various methods are proposed. Best results are obtained with the described bag of n-gram and character n-gram approaches introduced for the first time for this task and allowing for advanced vector space representation of the spoken contents. Furthermore, string kernels are considered. By early fusion and combined space optimization of the proposed linguistic features with acoustic ones, the regression of continuous emotion primitives outperforms reported benchmark results on the VAM corpus of highly emotional face-to-face communication. © 2011 IEEE.",Affective computing; sentiment analysis; speech emotion recognition; string kernels; support vector regression,Affective Computing; Sentiment analysis; speech emotion recognition; string kernels; support vector regression; Human computer interaction; Linguistics; Vector spaces; Three dimensional,2-s2.0-84857841688

A key enabler of opinion extraction and summarization is sentiment classification: the task of automatically identifying whether a given piece of text expresses positive or negative opinion towards a topic of interest. Building high-quality sentiment classifiers using standard text categorization methods is challenging due to the lack of labeled data in a target domain. In this paper, we consider the problem of cross-domain sentiment analysis: can one, for instance, download rated movie reviews from rottentomatoes.com or IMBD discussion forums, learn linguistic expressions and sentiment-laden terms that generally characterize opinionated commentary and then successfully transfer this knowledge to the target domain, thereby building high-quality sentiment models without manual effort? We outline a novel sentiment transfer mechanism based on constrained non-negative matrix tri-factorizations of term-document matrices in the source and target domains. The constrained matrix factorization framework naturally incorporates document labels via a least squares penalty incurred by a certain linear model and enables direct and explicit knowledge transfer across different domains. We obtain promising empirical results with this approach.

We present methods for text normalization of the noisy tweets and their classification with respect to the polarity. We experiment with a mixture model approach for generation of sentimental words, which are later used as indicator features of the classification model. Based on a gold standard manually annotated ensemble of tweets, with the new approach, we obtain F-scores that are relatively 10% better than a classification baseline that uses raw word n-gram features. ©2010 IEEE.",Feature extraction; Micro-blogs; Probabilistic graphical models; Sentiment analysis; Twitter,Classification models; Gold standards; Machine-learning; Micro-blogs; Mixture model; Negative sentiments; New approaches; Non-polar; Probabilistic graphical models; Probabilistic models; Products and services; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Twitter; Classification (of information); Data mining; Graphic methods; Internet; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; Text processing; Feature extraction,2-s2.0-79951783404

I consider myself extremely fortunate to have met people during my freshman year who are largely responsible for who I am now. My six best friends could not have been more different from me. Michelle is from Saudi Arabia but is half American, half Thai. Ana is from Madrid, Spain, and is a really strong, feminist woman. Cornelia is African American from Chicago. Suneela is Indian. My roommate, Grace, is Chinese and very religious. Brandi is white but she grew up poor and has beaten the welfare system. She is the most determined person I have ever met. Grace and Suneela are first generation Americans and still have strong ties to their native cultural traditions and language. And, of course, everybody else offered me perspectives I had never thought about or considered before. I am sure that I could have taken some classes and learned about all of the different things these people have taught me during my years at Michigan. That would have been interesting but because these women became my friends, I got to learn about it and experience it. I think that having the experiences is really the only teacher that ever changes how a person thinks about and sees the world. As fantastic as U of M classes can be, I know that they would never have affected me to the extent that these women have. This young woman from a small town values her experiences with students from diverse backgrounds because they have changed her world. Her experience reflects the evidence in the social science research provided the courts in the cases testing the University of Michigan's use of race as a factor in admission. This research demonstrates that a racially and ethnically diverse student body has significant educational benefits for all students, nonminority and minority alike. We presented the courts a social science argument and evidence on the educational value of diversity and were joined by other social scientists in amicus briefs in the cases eventually decided by the Supreme Court. In a five-to-four decision in Grutter v. Bollinger et al. (123 S.Ct. 2325, 2337-41), the Court found that student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify using race in university admissions. . . . Attaining a diverse student body is at the heart of the Law School's proper institutional mission. . . . The Law School's claim is further bolstered by numerous expert studies and reports showing that such diversity promotes learning outcomes and better prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce, for society, and for the legal profession. Major American businesses have made clear that the skills needed in today's increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints. High-ranking retired officers and civilian military leaders assert that a highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps is essential to national security. Moreover, because universities, and in particular, law schools, represent the training ground for a large number of the Nation's leaders, Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629, 634, the path to leadership must be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity. Thus, the Law School has a compelling interest in attaining a diverse student body. (3-4) When the University of Michigan was sued by Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher over its undergraduate admissions proce- dures and by Barbara Grutter over its Law School admissions procedures, we were asked to determine whether, why, and how diversity has educational benefits. The educational value of diversity was to be a cornerstone of the University of Michigan's arguments, and research evidence was critical. Although the value of diversity had been the rationale for considering race as one of many factors in college admissions ever since the 1978 Bakke decision, the arguments offered in other court cases lacked the strong theoretical rationale and empirical evidence needed to link diversity and education. As it turned out, social science research had great importance in the Grutter and Gratz cases before the Supreme Court. As social scientists, we addressed three issues: Does diversity have educational benefits? How and why might students benefit from being educated in diverse classrooms and on diverse campuses? We developed a theoretical rationale for the educational value of racial and ethnic diversity, reviewed available evidence, and carried out our own analyses of relevant data sets to test the theory that we offered. In this chapter, we highlight the most important aspects of these materials, including related research that has been conducted since our research was provided to the district court.1 We also present and respond to questions and criticisms that have been raised about the value of diversity during the legal battle that began in 1997 and was resolved by the Supreme Court in June 2003. In our expert testimony2 we emphasized the impact of actual experiences students have with diverse peers (in the classroom and in informal settings on the campus) on two educational outcomes- learning outcomes and democracy outcomes. Thus, from the outset we focused on the broad meaning of diversity: not only how it improves engagement in learning (what Lehman in this volume calls the ""pedagogic vision of diversity"") but more broadly how it fosters sentiments and skills necessary for citizenship and leadership in a diverse democracy. We argued that experience with diverse peers fosters these educational outcomes, and provided evidence from our own analyses, and the work of other scholars, that supported this argument.

Analysis of the congressional debates and relevant media texts shows that lawmakers, in concert with the popular media, produced a legislative penal drama in which they spoke to key audiences' - particularly white, working and middle class voters' - mistrust of penal practitioners and criminal justice experts, prejudices toward (black and brown) street criminals, fears about crime and anxiety over the economy, the transformed labor market and access to higher education. The article contends that the timing and texture of the Pell Grant affair were symbiotically related to a confluence of developments in the political and related fields during the 1980s and early 1990s. It extends Emile Durkheim's communicative theory of penality to encompass notions of class power and political interest. By producing such legislative penal dramas, lawmakers simultaneously tap into and legitimize collective sentiments of particular audiences, highlight symbolic boundaries between in- and out-groups and shore up political electoral support for punitive polices.

Our theory suggests an overall consistent organization of the investors forming a collective network which interact to form the pessimistic bearish ""anti-bubble"" regime with intermittent acceleration of the positive feedbacks of pessimistic sentiment leading to these crashes. We develop retrospective predictions, that confirm the existence of significant arbitrage opportunities for a trader using our model.

Design: A secondary analysis of survey data was conducted with a sample of 799 nurses; 547 were born in the United States (US) and 252 were from 34 other countries. Methods: Culture of origin was coded according to Hofstede's classification system. Nursing values related to the professional practice environment were measured using the Nursing Work Index, and burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Analysis of variance and least-squares regression procedures were used to test hypotheses. Findings: No significant differences were found between U.S. and international nurses in the overall degree to which they valued a professional nursing practice environment. A professional practice environment had a significant, inverse effect on job-related burnout on both U.S. and international nurses. Conclusions: These findings challenge a prevailing sentiment that international nurses hold values inconsistent with professional practice models as defined in the U.S. context. These findings also show that absence of a professional practice environment will produce similar high levels of burnout in both U.S. and foreign-born nurses.

However, in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (1915 [1912]) he places great emphasis on concrete and witnessable aspects of practice such as sounds and movements and downplays the importance of beliefs and representations. He argues that ritual sounds and movements, when collectively enacted, can create sentiments that give rise to the essential concepts that he refers to as the categories of the understanding. Representations are, in his view, secondary phenomena that arise only after participation in social practices. This article demonstrates through an analysis of Durkheim's text that he carefully referred to ritual practices in concrete and not representational terms at strategic points in the argument. Furthermore, it is argued that the collective experience of concrete sounds and movements was, on Durkheim's view, a prerequisite for the subsequent development of representations. © 2001, SAGE Publications.

In this paper we present SentiCircles, a lexicon-based approach for sentiment analysis on Twitter. Different from typical lexicon-based approaches, which offer a fixed and static prior sentiment polarities of words regardless of their context, SentiCircles takes into account the co-occurrence patterns of words in different contexts in tweets to capture their semantics and update their pre-assigned strength and polarity in sentiment lexicons accordingly. Our approach allows for the detection of sentiment at both entity-level and tweet-level. We evaluate our proposed approach on three Twitter datasets using three different sentiment lexicons to derive word prior sentiments. Results show that our approach significantly outperforms the baselines in accuracy and F-measure for entity-level subjectivity (neutral vs. polar) and polarity (positive vs. negative) detections. For tweet-level sentiment detection, our approach performs better than the state-of-the-art SentiStrength by 4-5% in accuracy in two datasets, but falls marginally behind by 1% in F-measure in the third dataset. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The motivation behind this work is twofold: First, although market-prediction through text-mining is shown to be a promising area of work in the literature, the text-mining approaches utilized in it at this stage are not much beyond basic ones as it is still an emerging field. This work is an effort to put more emphasis on the text-mining methods and tackle some specific aspects thereof that are weak in previous works, namely: the problem of high dimensionality as well as the problem of ignoring sentiment and semantics in dealing with textual language. This research assumes that addressing these aspects of text-mining have an impact on the quality of the achieved results. The proposed system proves this assumption to be right. The second part of the motivation is to research a specific market, namely, the foreign exchange market, which seems not to have been researched in the previous works based on predictive text-mining. Therefore, results of this work also successfully demonstrate a predictive relationship between this specific market-type and the textual data of news. Besides the above two main components of the motivation, there are other specific aspects that make the setup of the proposed system and the conducted experiment unique, for example, the use of news article-headlines only and not news article-bodies, which enables usage of short pieces of text rather than long ones; or the use of general financial breaking news without any further filtration. In order to accomplish the above, this work produces a multi-layer algorithm that tackles each of the mentioned aspects of the text-mining problem at a designated layer. The first layer is termed the Semantic Abstraction Layer and addresses the problem of co-reference in text mining that is contributing to sparsity. Co-reference occurs when two or more words in a text corpus refer to the same concept. This work produces a custom approach by the name of Heuristic-Hypernyms Feature-Selection which creates a way to recognize words with the same parent-word to be regarded as one entity. As a result, prediction accuracy increases significantly at this layer which is attributed to appropriate noise-reduction from the feature-space. The second layer is termed Sentiment Integration Layer, which integrates sentiment analysis capability into the algorithm by proposing a sentiment weight by the name of SumScore that reflects investors' sentiment. Additionally, this layer reduces the dimensions by eliminating those that are of zero value in terms of sentiment and thereby improves prediction accuracy. The third layer encompasses a dynamic model creation algorithm, termed Synchronous Targeted Feature Reduction (STFR). It is suitable for the challenge at hand whereby the mining of a stream of text is concerned. It updates the models with the most recent information available and, more importantly, it ensures that the dimensions are reduced to the absolute minimum. The algorithm and each of its layers are extensively evaluated using real market data and news content across multiple years and have proven to be solid and superior to any other comparable solution. The proposed techniques implemented in the system, result in significantly high directional-accuracies of up to 83.33%. On top of a well-rounded multifaceted algorithm, this work contributes a much needed research framework for this context with a test-bed of data that must make future research endeavors more convenient. The produced algorithm is scalable and its modular design allows improvement in each of its layers in future research.

In this context, we address the following 4 pertinent issues: how to best represent lexical information; whether standard features used for English are useful for Arabic; how to handle Arabic dialects; and, whether genre specific features have a measurable impact on performance. Our results show that using either lemma or lexeme information is helpful, as well as using the two part of speech tagsets (RTS and ERTS).

An improved understanding of the discourse on Twitter that encourages marijuana use can be helpful for tailoring and targeting online and offline prevention messages. Objectives: The intent of the study was to assess the content of tweets and the demographics of followers of a popular pro-marijuana Twitter handle (@stillblazingtho). Methods: We assessed the sentiment and content of tweets (sent from May 1 to December 31, 2013), as well as the demographics of consumers that follow a popular pro-marijuana Twitter handle (approximately 1,000,000 followers) using Twitter analytics from Demographics Pro. This analytics company estimates demographic characteristics based on Twitter behavior/usage, relying on multiple data signals from networks, consumption, and language and requires confidence of 95% or above to make an estimate of a single demographic characteristic. Results: A total of 2590 tweets were sent from @stillblazingtho during the 8-month period and 305 (11.78%) replies to another Twitter user were excluded for qualitative analysis. Of the remaining 2285 tweets, 1875 (82.06%) were positive about marijuana, 403 (17.64%) were neutral, and 7 (0.31%) appeared negative about marijuana. Approximately 1101 (58.72%) of the positive marijuana tweets were perceived as jokes or humorous, 340 (18.13%) implied that marijuana helps you to feel good or relax, 294 (15.68%) mentioned routine, frequent, or heavy use, 193 (10.29%) mentioned blunts, marijuana edibles, or paraphernalia (eg, bongs, vaporizers), and 186 (9.92%) mentioned other risky health behaviors (eg, tobacco, alcohol, other drugs, sex). The majority (699,103/959,143; 72.89%) of @stillblazingtho followers were 19 years old or younger.

We designed five SMO based supervised classifiers for five personality traits. We observe that the use of common sense knowledge with affective and sentiment information enhances the accuracy of the existing frameworks which use only psycho-linguistic features and frequency based analysis at lexical level. © Springer-Verlag 2013.",Affective and sentiment information; Common sense knowledge; Personality detection,Affective and sentiment information; Commonsense knowledge; Opinion mining; Personality detections; Personality recognition; Personality traits; Sentiment analysis; Supervised classifiers; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Linguistics; Soft computing; Knowledge based systems,2-s2.0-84893799597

Macro-economic indicators of the Great Recession such as the Consumer Sentiment Index and unemployment and home foreclosure rates were matched to the data to estimate the links between different measures of the Great Recession and high frequency maternal spanking. We find that the large decline in consumer confidence during the Great Recession, as measured by the Consumer Sentiment Index, was associated with worse parenting behavior. In particular, lower levels of consumer confidence were associated with increased levels of high frequency spanking, a parenting behavior that is associated with greater likelihood of being contacted by child protective services. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Abuse; Child maltreatment; Parenting; Recession; Spanking,article; behavior; child; child abuse; child neglect; child parent relation; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; male; physical abuse; preschool child; school child; sexual abuse; unemployment; United States; wellbeing; child abuse; child welfare; economic recession; educational status; epidemiology; psychology; risk factor; social class; socioeconomics; trends; Child; Child Abuse; Child Welfare; Cohort Studies; Economic Recession; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Male; Parenting; Risk Factors; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Unemployment; United States,2-s2.0-84885078730

Then, a small set of cue-phrase-based patterns were utilized to collect a large number of discourse instances which were later converted to semantic sequential representations (SSRs). Finally, an unsuper-vised method was adopted to generate, weigh and filter new SSRs without cue phrases for recognizing discourse relations.

We conduct an analysis of the annotated corpus, from which we show there is a significant level of topic shift within this collection, and also illustrate the difficulty that human annotators have when annotating certain sentiment categories. To deal with the problem of topic shift within blog articles, we propose text extraction techniques to create topic-specific sub-documents, which we use to train a sentiment classifier.

Participants included 270 middle-aged (40-50 years old) and older (60-70 years old) couples who discussed a marital disagreement and completed an errand task. Couples provided appraisals of their spouse's affiliation, and the authors coded affiliative interactions using the structural analysis of social behavior. Hierarchical multivariate linear modeling indicated that older husbands and wives viewed their spouse's behavior as more positive during disagreement interactions than did independent observers; in the errand task, only older wives demonstrated positive sentiment override. Age differences in positive sentiment override were mediated by marital satisfaction, even when controlling for optimism.

After completing measures of love, liking, commitment, and closeness, the partners of each dyad were questioned about any words, phrases, or nonverbal signs they had created that had meaning unique to their relationship. The 647 idioms reported were coded for their form (i.e., verbal versus nonverbal), context of use (i.e., private idioms, which were used only when others were not present, versus public idioms, which could be used in the presence of others), and function (i.e., confrontations, expressions of affection, labels for outsiders, nicknames, requests, sexual invitations, sexual references/euphemisms, and teasing insults). For both sexes, loving, commitment, and closeness were correlated with number of reported idioms that expressed affection, initiated sexual encounters, and referred to sexual matters. The only significant relationship for liking was between females' liking scores and the frequency of idioms with sexual referents. A log‐linear analysis revealed a significant association between the function of the idioms and their form; labels for outsiders, nicknames, sexual references/euphemisms, and teasing insults were almost always verbal. A significant association was also found between idiom function and context of use; labels for outsiders and teasing insults were most often used in situations involving other people, whereas sexual invitations and sexual references/euphemisms were usually used in private situations. Finally, males were the inventors of idioms much more often than females. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",,,2-s2.0-84986405907

Such systems have been shown to be useful to solve problems that are difficult for computers, including entity resolution, sentiment analysis, and image recognition. In this paper, we investigate the online task assignment problem: Given a pool of n questions, which of the k questions should be assigned to a worker? A poor assignment may not only waste time and money, but may also hurt the quality of a crowdsourcing application that depends on the workers' answers. We propose to consider quality measures (also known as evaluation metrics) that are relevant to an application during the task assignment process. Particularly, we explore how Accuracy and F-score, two widely-used evaluation metrics for crowdsourcing applications, can facilitate task assignment. Since these two metrics assume that the ground truth of a question is known, we study their variants that make use of the probability distributions derived from workers' answers. We further investigate online assignment strategies, which enables optimal task assignments. Since these algorithms are expensive, we propose solutions that attain high quality in linear time. We develop a system called the Quality-Aware Task Assignment System for Crowdsourcing Applications (QASCA) on top of AMT. We evaluate our approaches on five real crowdsourcing applications.

The research described in this article is focused on identifying key values of components to represent underlying characteristics of this linguistic phenomenon. In the absence of a negation marker, we focus on representing the core of irony by means of three conceptual layers. These layers involve 8 different textual features. By representing four available data sets with these features, we try to find hints about how to deal with this unexplored task from a computational point of view.

The motivation lies not only on the widespread consensus that the VIX is a barometer of the overall market sentiment as to what concerns investors' risk appetite, but also on the fact that there are many trading strategies that rely on the VIX index for hedging and speculative purposes. Preliminary analysis suggests that the VIX index displays long-range dependence. This is well in line with the strong empirical evidence in the literature supporting long memory in both options-implied and realized variances. We thus resort to both parametric and semiparametric heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) processes for modeling and forecasting purposes. Our main findings are as follows. First, we confirm the evidence in the literature that there is a negative relationship between the VIX index and the S&P 500 index return as well as a positive contemporaneous link with the volume of the S&P 500 index. Second, the term spread has a slightly negative long-run impact in the VIX index, when possible multicollinearity and endogeneity are controlled for. Finally, we cannot reject the linearity of the above relationships, neither in sample nor out of sample. As for the latter, we actually show that it is pretty hard to beat the pure HAR process because of the very persistent nature of the VIX index. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Heterogeneous autoregression; Implied volatility; Neural networks; VIX,,2-s2.0-84890319583

To facilitate this modeling, a novel estimation technique is developed for multinomial logistic regression with very high-dimensional response. In particular, independent Laplace priors with unknown variance are assigned to each regression coefficient, and we detail an efficient routine for maximization of the joint posterior over coefficients and their prior scale. This ""gamma-lasso"" scheme yields stable and effective estimation for general high-dimensional logistic regression, and we argue that it will be superior to current methods in many settings. Guidelines for prior specification are provided, algorithm convergence is detailed, and estimator properties are outlined from the perspective of the literature on nonconcave likelihood penalization. Related work on sentiment analysis from statistics, econometrics, and machine learning is surveyed and connected. Finally, the methods are applied in two detailed examples and we provide out-of-sample prediction studies to illustrate their effectiveness. © 2013 American Statistical Association.",Multinomial logistic regression; Nonconcave penalization; Regularized regression; Text mining,,2-s2.0-84888128053

Exploiting this data by extracting useful information from it has become a great challenge in data mining and knowledge discovery. A recently popular way of extracting useful information from social network platforms is to build indicators, often in the form of a time series, of general public mood by means of sentiment analysis. Such indicators have been shown to correlate with a diverse variety of phenomena. In this article we follow this line of work and set out to assess, in a rigorous manner, whether a public sentiment indicator extracted from daily Twitter messages can indeed improve the forecasting of social, economic, or commercial indicators. To this end we have collected and processed a large amount of Twitter posts from March 2011 to the present date for two very different domains: stock market and movie box office revenue. For each of these domains, we build and evaluate forecasting models for several target time series both using and ignoring the Twitter-related data. If Twitter does help, then this should be reflected in the fact that the predictions of models that use Twitter-related data are better than the models that do not use this data. By systematically varying the models that we use and their parameters, together with other tuning factors such as lag or the way in which we build our Twitter sentiment index, we obtain a large dataset that allows us to test our hypothesis under different experimental conditions. Using a novel decision-tree-based technique that we call summary tree we are able to mine this large dataset and obtain automatically those configurations that lead to an improvement in the prediction power of our forecasting models. As a general result, we have seen that nonlinear models do take advantage of Twitter data when forecasting trends in volatility indices, while linear ones fail systematically when forecasting any kind of financial time series. In the case of predicting box office revenue trend, it is support vector machines that make best use of Twitter data. In addition, we conduct statistical tests to determine the relation between our Twitter time series and the different target time series. © 2013 ACM 2157-6904/2013/12-ART5 $ 15.00.",Box office; Forecasting; Sentiment index; Stock market; Twitter,Box office; Data mining and knowledge discovery; Experimental conditions; Financial time series; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment index; Stock market; Twitter; Commerce; Data mining; Economics; Finance; Financial data processing; Forecasting; Information use; Motion pictures; Statistical tests; Time series; Social networking (online),2-s2.0-84891765968

In recent years, statistical models have been used for the task. However, such models without any domain knowledge often produce aspects that are not interpretable in applications. To tackle the issue, some knowledge-based topic models have been proposed, which allow the user to input some prior domain knowledge to generate coherent aspects. However, existing knowledge-based topic models have several major shortcomings, e.g., little work has been done to incorporate the cannot-link type of knowledge or to automatically adjust the number of topics based on domain knowledge. This paper proposes a more advanced topic model, called MC-LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), to address these problems, which is based on an Extended generalized Pólya urn (E-GPU) model (which is also proposed in this paper).

We hypothesise that self-transcendent individuals are more supportive of, and conservative individuals are more adverse to, immigration. We do not expect large differences in the effect of values across contexts. To explain cross-country and cross-time differences we use group threat theory, according to which larger inflows of immigration combined with challenging economic conditions impose a threat on the host society, resulting in more negative attitudes towards immigration. To test our hypotheses we use data from the first three rounds of the European Social Survey (2002-03, 2004-05 and 2006-07) and multilevel analysis.

The results indicate that investor sentiment plays a significant role in explaining subsequent mutual fund herding, especially on the sell-side. Specifically, the evidence is consistent with the funds sharing an aversion to stocks that have previously exhibited higher optimistic sentiment, supporting the sentiment countering hypothesis.

To evaluate the adopted algorithm and resources, two independent judges were asked to label the top words of ranking list. It is observed that noise is almost unavoidable due to imprecise similarity metrics between words.

The fact that the card is not a pure gift is the source of social criticisms of cards as impersonal. But the card's ambiguous status is also at the heart of its unique communicative potential. Analysis of specific cards and card categories shows how card senders can exploit various and multiple dimensions of the card's gift and commodity-like qualities to express socially authenticated identities and sentiments, as well as to send subtle and complex new messages about identities and relationships. Card use also shows how commodities can be 'appropriated' as gifts in the act of shopping and choosing; moreover, the consumption of cards is depicted as a dynamic site of 'virtual' interactions between sender and receiver. The specific case of greeting cards is used to illustrate the more general point that most things are not intrinsically 'gifts' or 'commodities'.

This study describes a new MADS box gene, nmhC5, which along with nmh7 (J. Heard and K. Dunn, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:5273-5277, 1995), is expressed in alfalfa (Medicago sativa) root nodules. Together, these genes represent the first putative transcription factors identified in nodules. Expression in a root-derived structure supports the growing sentiment that MADS box proteins have diverse roles in plant development. Comparison of the putative translation product of nmhC5 with those of other reported members of the MADS box family suggests that the overall structure of nmhC5 is conserved. Evolutionary analysis among the MADS box family showed that nmhC5 is orthologous to a root-expressed clone in Arabidopsis thaliana, agl17, and that nmh7 is similar to the floral subfamily with AP3 (DefA)/PI (Glo). Consistent with a prediction of homodimer formation, NMHC5 was shown to bind a CArG consensus sequence in vitro. In contrast, NMH7, which shows structural similarity to MADS box proteins that form heterodimers, did not bind the CArG element in an in vitro DNA-binding assay, suggesting the existence of an unknown dimer partner. The root-derived MADS box genes constitute a novel subfamily of vegetatively expressed MADS box genes. The evolutionary diversity between nmh7 and nmhC5 could represent an overall mechanistic conservation between plant developmental processes or could mean that nmh7 and nmhC5 make fundamentally different contributions to the development of the nodule.",,"complementary DNA; DNA binding protein; MADS domain protein; plant DNA; primer DNA; transcription factor; vegetable protein; alfalfa; amino acid sequence; article; Escherichia coli; gene; genetic variability; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microbiology; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; plant root; polymerase chain reaction; Rhizobium; symbiosis; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Conserved Sequence; DNA Primers; DNA, Complementary; DNA, Plant; DNA-Binding Proteins; Escherichia coli; Evolution, Molecular; Genes, Plant; MADS Domain Proteins; Medicago sativa; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rhizobium; Symbiosis; Transcription Factors; Variation (Genetics); Arabidopsis thaliana; Escherichia coli; Medicago sativa; Rhizobium",2-s2.0-0031195040

These societal value judgements can be expressed in the form of preferences. Whereas the inequality perception of income distributions appeals to an observer's sober judgement, the revelation of preferences with respect to specific income distributions appeals to his or her sentiments. This paper is an empirical analysis which investigates the juxtaposition of preferences with respect to income distributions and corresponding perceptions of distributional inequality. We do this through a questionnaire in which attitudes towards various distributional axioms are tested. The source of our data is 1773 completed questionnaires collected from five German universities. Based on our data, we observe that individuals' preference orderings over the set of income distributions substantially deviate from their perceptions of distributional inequality. In fact, our test responses showed that even when some income distribution is judged to be more unequal than another, that distribution might be preferred, as it accords higher incomes to each individual. We hold that the preference for these greater incomes expresses a compensation for the increased degree of inequality.

Thus, automatically analyzing electoral tweets has applications in understanding how public sentiment is shaped, tracking public sentiment and polarization with respect to candidates and issues, understanding the impact of tweets from various entities, etc. Here, for the first time, we automatically annotate a set of 2012 US presidential election tweets for a number of attributes pertaining to sentiment, emotion, purpose, and style by crowdsourcing. Overall, more than 100,000 crowdsourced responses were obtained for 13 questions on emotions, style, and purpose. Additionally, we show through an analysis of these annotations that purpose, even though correlated with emotions, is significantly different. Finally, we describe how we developed automatic classifiers, using features from state-of-the-art sentiment analysis systems, to predict emotion and purpose labels, respectively, in new unseen tweets. These experiments establish baseline results for automatic systems on this new data. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

By adopting an institutional approach and defining moral legitimacy as ""a positive normative evaluation of the organization and its activities"", the goal of this paper is to investigate which corporate communication strategy adopted in online social media is more effective to create convergence between corporations' corporate social responsibility (CSR) agenda and stakeholders' social expectations, and thereby, to increase corporate legitimacy. Design/methodology/approach: Using the entire Twitter social graph, a network analysis was carried out to study the structural properties of the CSR community, such as the level of reciprocity, and advanced data mining techniques, i.e. topic and sentiment analysis, were carried out to investigate the communication dynamics. Findings: Evidence was found that neither the engaging nor the information strategies lead to alignment. The assumption of the more the dialog, the more the communality seems to fail to portray the complexity of the communicational dynamics, such as the persistence of different, or simply a dialog without alignment. Empirical findings show that, even when engaging in a dialogue, communication in social media is still conceived as a marketing practice to convey messages about companies. Originality/value: This paper originally investigates organizational legitimacy in the context of social media by applying advanced data-mining techniques that allow the analysis of large amounts of information available online. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Communication strategies; Communications; Corporate social responsibility; Organizational legitimacy; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Social responsibility; Topic analysis,,2-s2.0-84878260005

This scenario posits new challenges to active learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel active learning approach, named co-selecting, by taking both the imbalanced class distribution issue and uncertainty into account. Specifically, our co-selecting approach employs two feature subspace classifiers to collectively select most informative minority-class samples for manual annotation by leveraging a certainty measurement and an uncertainty measurement, and in the meanwhile, automatically label most informative majority-class samples, to reduce human-annotation efforts. Extensive experiments across four domains demonstrate great potential and effectiveness of our proposed co-selecting approach to active learning for imbalanced sentiment classification. © 2012 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,Active Learning; Feature subspace; Imbalanced class; Manual annotation; Negative samples; Sentiment classification; Uncertainty measurements; Uncertainty analysis; Natural language processing systems,2-s2.0-84883409515

A sentence often contains independent clauses which can represent different opinions on the multiple aspects of a target object. Therefore, the proposed system provides clause-level sentiment analysis of opinionated texts. For each sentence in a message post, it generates a dependency tree, and splits the sentence into clauses. Then it determines the contextual sentiment score for each clause utilizing grammatical dependencies of words and the prior sentiment scores of the words derived from SentiWordNet and domain specific lexicons. Negation is also delicately handled in this study, for instance, the term ""not superb"" is assigned a lower negative sentiment score than the term ""not good"".

Supervised machine learning techniques can perform this task very effectively. However, they require a large corpus of training data, and a number of studies have demonstrated that the good performance of supervised models is dependent on a good match between the training and testing data with respect to the domain, topic and time-period. Weakly-supervised techniques use a large collection of unlabelled text to determine sentiment, and so their performance may be less dependent on the domain, topic and time-period represented by the testing data. This paper presents experiments that investigate the effectiveness of word similarity techniques when performing weakly-supervised sentiment classification. It also considers the extent to which the performance of each method is independent from the domain, topic and time-period of the testing data. The results indicate that the word similarity techniques are suitable for applications that require sentiment classification across several domains.

Transport geography has been criticized by some for being a quiet corner of our discipline that has lost its centrality largely because it remains within the analytical framework of the 1960s. This article explores these sentiments by reexamining recent transport-oriented research in highly cited geography journals to assess the degree to which the qualitative-quantitative divide exists within transport geography and between transport and other subfield in human geography, as well as to explore issues of productivity and centrality of transport-oriented research in geography. Results indicate that geographical research involving transport topics is much more prevalent and reflects a wider range of epistemological and methodological approaches than is frequently assumed. Nevertheless, there is still a considerable divide between ""mainstream"" transport geography and other human geographical research that necessitates much more interaction between transport and other subfields and greater incorporation of alternative research approaches within the mainstream of transport geography. To that end, we propose a preliminary critical transport geography research agenda that is open to a variety of methodological approaches, including quantitative analysis. © Copyright 2009 by Association of American Geographers.",Centrality; Critical geography; Critical transport geography; Qualitative-quantitative divide; Transport geography,critical analysis; geographical research; human geography; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; transportation,2-s2.0-65649129691

This study, on the other hand, seeks to establish evidence on unbiased justice and to propose and demonstrate a general approach for measuring impartial views empirically. Most normative justice theories associate impartiality with limited information and consensus. In both the normative and positive literature, information is usually seen as the raw material for self-serving bias and disagreement. In contrast, this paper proposes a type of impartiality that is associated with a high level of information and that results in consensus. The crucial distinction is the emphasis here on the views of impartial spectators, rather than implicated stakeholders. I describe the quasi-spectator method, i.e., an empirical means to approximate the views of impartial spectators. Results of a questionnaire provide evidence on quasi-spectator views and support this approach as a means to elicit moral preferences. By establishing a relationship between consensus and impartiality, this paper helps lay an empirical foundation for welfare analysis, social choice theory and practical policy applications.

The difficulties involved in using these terms as tools of cross-cultural analysis suggest that a concentration on indigenous terms and their applications is preferable. In the Mount Hagen area of Papua New Guinea the most significant organizing concept in this domain is that of noman, variously glossed as mind, consciousness, intention, will, social sentiment, and understanding. The idea of the noman is thus an ontology in and of action that engages personhood with history and biography in contemporary lives among the Hagen or Melpa people. The noman is seen as in a continuous process of differentiation and change over a lifetime, and it encompasses ideas of process, incompletion/completion, relationality, individuality, character, creativity, and identity. Two different life-history narratives are used to show how people seek their personhood over time. We interpret their narratives as stories of how they attempt to achieve 'a strong noman'. They monitor their own successes and failures in contexts of change and turbulence in their lives with reference to their overall wishes and ideals, and this corresponds to an assessment of the state of their noman.",,,2-s2.0-0032399486

Statistical, supervised automatic methods for emotion detection rely on text that is labeled for emotions, but such data are rare and available for only a handful of basic emotions. In this article, we show that emotion-word hashtags are good manual labels of emotions in tweets. We also propose a method to generate a large lexicon of word-emotion associations from this emotion-labeled tweet corpus. This is the first lexicon with real-valued word-emotion association scores. We begin with experiments for six basic emotions and show that the hashtag annotations are consistent and match with the annotations of trained judges. We also show how the extracted tweet corpus and word-emotion associations can be used to improve emotion classification accuracy in a different nontweet domain.Eminent psychologist Robert Plutchik had proposed that emotions have a relationship with personality traits. However, empirical experiments to establish this relationship have been stymied by the lack of comprehensive emotion resources. Because personality may be associated with any of the hundreds of emotions and because our hashtag approach scales easily to a large number of emotions, we extend our corpus by collecting tweets with hashtags pertaining to 585 fine emotions. Then, for the first time, we present experiments to show that fine emotion categories such as those of excitement, guilt, yearning, and admiration are useful in automatically detecting personality from text.

However, variable levels of adherence have yielded mixed results across several PrEP trials and populations. It is not clear how taking ARV - traditionally used for HIV treatment - is perceived and how that perception may affect the use of these products as preventives. We explored the views and experiences of VOICE participants, their male partners and community members regarding the use of ARV as PrEP in the VOICE trial and the implications of these shared meanings for adherence. Methods: VOICE-C was a qualitative ancillary study conducted at the Johannesburg site of VOICE, a multisite, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial testing tenofovir gel, oral tenofovir and oral Truvada® for HIV PrEP. We interviewed 102 randomly selected female VOICE participants, 22 male partners and 40 community members through in-depth interviews, serial ethnography, or focus group discussions. All interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, translated and coded thematically for analysis. Results: The concept of ARV for prevention was understood to varying degrees across all study groups. A majority of VOICE participants understood that the products contained ARV, more so for the tablets than for the gel. Although participants knew they were HIV negative, ARV was associated with illness. Male partners and community members echoed these sentiments, highlighting confusion between treatment and prevention. Concerned that they would be mistakenly identified as HIV positive, VOICE participants often concealed use of or hid their study products. This occasionally led to relationship conflicts or early trial termination. HIV stigma and its association with ARV, especially the tablets, was articulated in rumour and gossip in the community, the workplace and the household. Although ARV were recognised as potent and beneficial medications, transforming the AIDS body from sickness to health, they were regarded as potentially harmful for those uninfected. Conclusions: VOICE participants and others in the trial community struggled to conceptualise the idea of using ARV for prevention. This possibly influenced willingness to adopt ARV-based prevention in the VOICE clinical trial. Greater investments should be made to increase community understanding of ARV for prevention and to mitigate pervasive HIV stigma. © 2014 van der Straten A et al; licensee International AIDS Society.",Adherence; Antiretroviral; HIV prevention; HIV stigma; Microbicides; Pre-exposure prophylaxis; Qualitative methods; South Africa,"antiretrovirus agent; emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil; microbicide; tenofovir; antiretrovirus agent; adult; Article; community; controlled study; double blind procedure; ethnography; female; health; household; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection prevention; interview; major clinical study; male; pre exposure prophylaxis; prophylaxis; qualitative research; randomized controlled trial; South Africa; stigma; workplace; chemoprophylaxis; disease transmission; HIV Infections; intravaginal drug administration; medication compliance; middle aged; oral drug administration; patient attitude; pre-exposure prophylaxis; prevention and control; procedures; psychology; young adult; Administration, Intravaginal; Administration, Oral; Adult; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Chemoprevention; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis; South Africa; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84916230041

There is little data available to examine the impact that popular Web 2.0 sites play on public perceptions of threatened species. YouTube videos portraying wildlife allow us to quantify these perceptions.Methodology/Principal Findings:Focussing on a group of threatened and globally protected primates, slow lorises, we quantify public attitudes towards wildlife conservation by analysing 12,411 comments and associated data posted on a viral YouTube video 'tickling slow loris' over a 33-months period. In the initial months a quarter of commentators indicated wanting a loris as a pet, but as facts about their conservation and ecology became more prevalent this dropped significantly. Endorsements, where people were directed to the site by celebrities, resulted mostly in numerous neutral responses with few links to conservation or awareness. Two conservation-related events, linked to Wikipedia and the airing of a television documentary, led to an increase in awareness, and ultimately to the removal of the analysed video.Conclusions/Significance:Slow loris videos that have gone viral have introduced these primates to a large cross-section of society that would not normally come into contact with them. Analyses of webometric data posted on the internet allow us quickly to gauge societal sentiments. We showed a clear temporal change in some views expressed but without an apparent increase in knowledge about the conservation plight of the species, or the illegal nature of slow loris trade. Celebrity endorsement of videos showing protected wildlife increases visits to such sites, but does not educate about conservation issues. The strong desire of commentators to express their want for one as a pet demonstrates the need for Web 2.0 sites to provide a mechanism via which illegal animal material can be identified and policed. © 2013 Nekaris et al.",,article; awareness; behaviorism; controlled study; endangered species; human; information dissemination; Internet; online analysis; perception; public opinion; social network; species conservation,2-s2.0-84880797911

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is supervised learning methods that analyze data and recognize the patterns that are used for classification. This research concerns on binary classification which is classified into two classes. Those classes are positive and negative. The positive class shows good message opinion; otherwise the negative class shows the bad message opinion of certain movies.

This study adds to the understanding of the REIT return generating process by exploring the behavioral impact of investor sentiment on REIT returns. The results show that when investors are optimistic (pessimistic), REIT returns become higher (lower). These findings are robust when conventional control variables are considered. Empirical analysis indicates steady erosion in the importance of the default and term structure interest rate variables previously considered as important determinants of REIT returns. Previous noise trading papers that consider the impact of institutional traders conclude that institutional investors cannot arbitrage away noise trader risk.

The important project characteristics influencing the accuracy of pre-tender building cost estimates are examined and practical improvement for increasing the accuracy of estimates are considered. A quantitative approach is used to address the research problem. Analysis of data from 56 projects and from a postal questionnaire survey of 102 quantity surveying firms suggests that the accuracy of pre-tender building cost estimates varies according to project size and principal structural material. When eight identified project characteristics are controlled in a multiple regression analysis, the accuracy of estimates is influenced by project size. The estimates of smaller projects are more biased than the estimates of larger projects. It was discovered that pre-tender building costs are more often overestimated than are underestimated. Overestimated forecasts are incorrect by a larger amount than underestimated forecasts. Data analysis also revealed that the accuracy of pre-tender building cost estimates has not improved over time. The majority of the respondents are somewhat dissatisfied with the accuracy of estimates in the industry. Probability estimation and simulation of past estimates, reducing quantity surveying and cost engineering skill turnover, incorporating market sentiments into estimates, early involvement of the quantity surveyor at the brief stage, and proper documentation of experience gained in the estimation of projects should help firms increase the accuracy of estimates for new projects.",Australia; Estimating accuracy; Pre-tender estimates; Quantity surveying; Tendering,Building materials; Buildings; Cost accounting; Costs; Regression analysis; Surveys; Australia; Estimating accuracy; Pre-tender estimates; Quantity surveying; Tendering; Cost benefit analysis; building; cost-benefit analysis; decision making; probability; project assessment; project design; quantitative analysis; questionnaire survey; surveying; Australasia; Australia,2-s2.0-57749119817

Objectives: To determine attitudes among physician leaders at emergency medicine training programs toward using PN-5b as a quality measure for pay for performance, and to determine what operational changes academic emergency departments (EDs) have made to ensure early antibiotic administration for patients with pneumonia. Methods: The authors administered an online questionnaire to 129 chairpersons and medical directors of 135 academic ED training programs in the United States on attitudes toward performance measurement in pneumonia and changes that academic EDs have made in response to PN-5b; one response was sought from each institution. Respondents were identified through the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine Web site and e-mailed five times to maximize survey participation. Results: Ninety chairpersons and medical directors (70%) completed the survey; 47% were medical directors, 51% were chairpersons, and 2% were medical directors and chairpersons. Forty-five (50%) did not agree that PN-5b was an accurate quality measure, and 61 (69%) did not agree that pay for performance targeting this measure would lead to improved pneumonia care. The most common strategy to address PN-5b was to provide information to providers on the importance of early treatment with antibiotics (n = 63; 70%). For patients with suspected pneumonia, 46 (51%) automate chest radiograph (CXR) ordering at triage, 37 (41%) prioritize patients with suspected pneumonia, and 33 (37%) administer antibiotics before obtaining CXR results. Overall ED changes include improved turnaround time for CXR (n = 33; 37%), prioritized CXRs over other radiographs (n = 13; 14%), and improved inpatient bed availability (n = 12; 13%). Of 13 strategies identified to improve PN-5b, the median number that programs have implemented is five (interquartile range, 5-7). All sites reported engaging in at least three operational changes to address PN-5b. Conclusions: All EDs in this study have addressed early antibiotic administration with multiple operational changes despite mixed sentiment that these changes will improve care. Future research is needed to measure the impact of pay-for-performance initiatives. © 2007 Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.",emergency department; patient safety; pay for performance; pneumonia; quality of care,"antibiotic agent; article; attitude; cost benefit analysis; emergency health service; health survey; human; patient care; physician; pneumonia; priority journal; questionnaire; thorax radiography; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Chi-Square Distribution; Efficiency, Organizational; Emergency Service, Hospital; Humans; Physician Incentive Plans; Pneumonia; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Quality Indicators, Health Care; Questionnaires; Regression Analysis; Statistics, Nonparametric; Time Factors; United States",2-s2.0-34249074736

While Granger causality tests have already been used to test for this, no attempt has been made yet to quantify the predictive power of the consumer sentiment index over different time horizons. In this article, we decompose the Granger causality at different time lags, by looking at a sequence of nested prediction models. Since the consumer sentiment index turns out to be cointegrated with real consumption, we resort to error correcting models. Four consumption series are studied, namely total real consumption, real consumption of durables, non-durables and services. Among other findings, we show that the consumer sentiment index Granger causes future consumption with an average time lag of 4-5 months. Furthermore, it is found that the consumer sentiment index has more incremental predictive power for consumption of services than for consumption of durables or non-durables, and that the index is not only useful as a predictor at the very short term, but keeps predictive power at larger time horizons.",,consumption behavior; decomposition analysis; Granger causality test; numerical model,2-s2.0-33845539887

While international investors were predictably upset, the response of the USA was more unusual. Instead of supporting foreign private creditors as it had during most sovereign debt crises of the 1980s and 1990s, the US government did very little. Indeed, since the initial default, US policy makers even went out of their way to express support for the Argentine government's tough negotiating stance vis-à-vis these creditors and the imf. The Argentine government's stance culminated in early 2005 in the most dramatic private debt restructuring of recent years, under which investors took a cut of roughly 70% on the value of their bond holdings. Although US policy towards the Argentine debt default and restructuring contrasted sharply with the Bush administration's aggressive broader foreign policy since September 2001, this article shows that it reflects familiar influences: strategic goals, neoliberal ideology and conservative anti-internationalist sentiments. The article concludes with a brief discussion of the implications of this US policy for the broader politics of international debt. © 2005 Third World Quarterly.",,debt; economic analysis; foreign policy; investment; Argentina; North America; South America; United States,2-s2.0-24744469130

Methods: With the use of key word ""Taiwan"", the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library of the University of California, San Francisco, was searched for internal documents related to smuggling activities, promotion of light cigarettes, and market share analyses in Taiwan. Age adjusted smoking rates and cigarette and betel quid consumption before and after market opening were compared. Results: By 2000, the market share of imported cigarettes increased from less than 2% in 1986 to nearly 50%, and per capita cigarette consumption increased 15% following market opening. Because of the sharp increase in smuggling, with contraband cigarettes being as popular as legal imports, and the rapid proliferation of retail outlets, such as betel quid stalls, the market penetration by foreign tobacco companies was greater in Taiwan than among the other Super 301 Asian countries. Aggressive cigarette marketing strategies were associated with a 6% increase in adult male smoking prevalence, and with a 13% increase in the youth rate, within three years after market opening. The market opening also had an incidental effect on increasing the popularity of betel quid. Betel quid chewing has since become a major public health problem in Taiwan. Conclusion: The opening of the cigarette market in 1987 had a long lasting impact on Taiwan. It increased smoking prevalence and the market has become dominated by foreign companies. The seriousness of smuggling and its associated loss of revenue by the government, the extent of increased youth smoking and its associated future health care costs, and the increased use of betel quid and the associated doubling of oral cancer mortality rates each pose significant problems to Taiwan. However, the market opening galvanised anti-smoking sentiment and forced the government to initiate and intensify a series of tobacco control efforts.",,article; Asia; betel nut; cigarette smoking; government; health care cost; health hazard; human; marketing; public health; smokeless tobacco; statistical significance; Taiwan; tobacco industry; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Advertising; Commerce; Crime; Government; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Public Health; Smoking; Taiwan; Tobacco Industry,2-s2.0-20444423643

In particular, we split a tweet into a left context and a right context according to a given target, using distributed word representations and neural pooling functions to extract features. Both sentiment-driven and standard embeddings are used, and a rich set of neural pooling functions are explored. Sentiment lexicons are used as an additional source of information for feature extraction.

However, due to the time and cost of human labor, solutions that rely solely on crowd-sourcing are o?en limited to small datasets (i.e., a few thousand items). This paper proposes algorithms for integrating machine learning into crowd-sourced databases in order to combine the accuracy of human labeling with the speed and coste ?ectiveness of machine learning classifiers. By using active learning as our optimization strategy for labeling tasks in crowd-sourced databases, we can minimize the number of questions asked to the crowd, allowing crowd-sourced applications to scale (i.e., labelmuch larger datasets at lower costs). Designing active learning algorithms for a crowd-sourced database posesmany practical challenges: such algorithms need to be generic, scalable, and easy to use, even for practitioners who are notmachine learning experts. We draw on the theory of nonparametric bootstrap to design, to the best of our knowledge, the first active learning algorithms that meet all these requirements. Our results, on 3 real-world datasets collected with AmazonsMechanical Turk, and on UCI datasets, show that our methods on average ask 1-2 orders of magnitude fewer questions than the baseline, and 4.5-44× fewer than existing active learning algorithms. © 2014 VLDB Endowment 2150-8097/14/10.",,Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Database systems; Learning systems; Active-learning algorithm; Entity resolutions; Integrating machines; Non-parametric bootstraps; Optimization strategy; Orders of magnitude; Real-world datasets; Sentiment analysis; Learning algorithms,2-s2.0-84938053293

Examining this spatial data has been particularly useful to researchers interested in monitoring and mapping disease outbreaks, like influenza. However, very little has been done to utilize this massive resource to examine other public health issues. This paper uses an advanced data-mining framework with a novel use of social media data retrieval and sentiment analysis to understand how geolocated tweets can be used to explore the prevalence of healthy and unhealthy food across the contiguous United States. Additionally, tweets are associated with spatial data provided by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) of low-income, low-access census tracts (e.g. food deserts), to examine whether tweets about unhealthy foods are more common in these disadvantaged areas. Results show that these disadvantaged census tracts tend to have both a lower proportion of tweets about healthy foods with a positive sentiment, and a higher proportion of unhealthy tweets in general. These findings substantiate the methods used by the USDA to identify regions that are at risk of having low access to healthy foods. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Food deserts; Nutrition; Public health; Spatial analysis; Twitter,food quality; mass media; media role; nutrition; public health; spatial analysis; World Wide Web; data mining; food; low income population; social network; United States,2-s2.0-84906860144

In contrast, our approach allows structured modeling of sentiment while taking into account both local and global contextual information. Specifically, we encode intuitive lexical and discourse knowledge as expressive constraints and integrate them into the learning of conditional random field models via posterior regularization. The context-aware constraints provide additional power to the CRF model and can guide semi-supervised learning when labeled data is limited.

This game, we play as a team.' Florida's sentiment has been echoed across a broad and interdisciplinary literature in social theory and public policy, producing a new conventional wisdom: that class antagonisms are redundant in today's climate of competitive professionalism and a dominant creative mainstream. Questions of social justice are thus deflected by reassurances that there is no 'I' in team, and that 'we' must always be defined by corporate membership rather than class-based solidarities. The post-industrial city becomes a post-political city nurtured by efficient, market-oriented governance leavened with a generous dose of multicultural liberalism. In this paper, we analyze how this Floridian fascination has spread into debates on contemporary urban social structure and neighbourhood change. In particular, we focus on recent arguments that London has become a thoroughly middle-class, post-industrial metropolis. We evaluate the empirical claims and interpretive generalizations of this literature by using the classical tools of urban factorial ecology to analyze small-area data from the UK Census. Our analysis documents a durable, fine-grained geography of social class division in London, which has been changed but not erased by ongoing processes of industrial and occupational restructuring: the central tensions of class in the city persist. Without critical empirical and theoretical analysis of the contours of post-industrial class division, the worsening inequalities of cities like London will be de-politicized.

We consider sentiment assessment and emotion sensing from text as two different problems, whereby sentiment assessment is the task that we want to solve first. Thus, this article presents an approach to sentiment assessment, i.e., the recognition of negative or positive valence of a sentence. For the purpose of sentiment recognition from text, we perform semantic dependency analysis on the semantic verb frames of each sentence, and then apply a set of rules to each dependency relation to calculate the contextual valence of the whole sentence. By employing a domain-independent, rule-based approach our system is able to automatically identify sentence-level sentiment. A linguistic tool called ""SenseNet"" has been developed to recognize sentiments in text, and to visualize the detected sentiments. We conducted several experiments with a variety of datasets containing data from different domains. The obtained results indicate significant performance gains over existing state-of-the-art approaches.

We argue that although important, such a preoccupation with the social distribution of objectified tastes - for example in music, literature, and art - has been at the expense of investigating the everyday perceptual schemes and resources used by actors to accomplish a judgement of taste. Our argument is traced using a range of classical and contemporary literature which deals with the personal/collective tension in taste, aesthetics and fashion. We use data from a recent national survey to investigate how a sample of ordinary actors understand the categories of 'good' and 'bad' taste. The analysis shows a strong collective strand in everyday definitions of taste, often linked to moral codes of interpersonal conduct. Also, taste is largely defined by people as a strategy for managing relations with others, and as a mode of self-discipline which relies on the mastery of a number of general principles that are resources for people to position their own tastes within an imagined social sphere. The paper proposes a schematic model which accounts for the range of discriminatory resources used to make judgements of taste. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",,,2-s2.0-2942618288

In this study, factors representing different aspects of residents' neighborhoods were identified and examined in relation to their overall assessment of their homes and neighborhoods. Relationships among neighborhood aspects and overall housing and neighborhood assessments were examined separately for residents of conventional homes, mobile homes, and apartments. Results based on all residents indicated that evaluations of neighborhood aspects were unrelated to housing satisfaction, but were moderately related to positive sentiments and satisfaction with the neighborhood. Separate analyses by housing type revealed that neighborhood perceptions of apartment residents were influential in affecting housing satisfaction. For all residents, the neighborhood's attractiveness and pleasant-friendliness were the most important determinants of neighborhood acceptance and satisfaction. The results also indicated that despite sharing similar determinant patterns of neighborhood acceptance with the other two housing type groups, the basis for mobile home residents' evaluations was considerably less related to the factors identified as influential. The findings indicated that different neighborhood factors formed the basis for differences in overall housing and neighborhood satisfaction among residents living in the three housing types. However, since the type of housing does not by itself define a neighborhood, the differences that were found need to be considered in the larger context of other components of a neighborhood like economic and community characteristics typically associated with a specific structure type. © 1987 D.

We found that during the matches that the U.S. team played, fear and anger were the most common negative emotions and in general, increased when the opponent team scored and decreased when the U.S. team scored. Anticipation and joy were also generally consistent with the goal results and the associated circumstances during the games. Furthermore, we found that during the matches between other teams, U.S. tweets showed more joy and anticipation than negative emotions (e.g., anger and fear) and that the patterns in response to goal or loss were unclear.

Testing a range of theoretical explanations, we find that individuals' own economic standing has limited explanatory power in accounting for their position on the bailouts. In contrast, social dispositions such as altruism and cosmopolitanism robustly correlate with support for the bailouts. The results indicate that the divide in public opinion over the bailouts does not reflect distributive lines separating domestic winners and losers. Instead, the bailout debate is better understood as a foreign policy issue that pits economic nationalist sentiments versus greater cosmopolitan affinity and other-regarding concerns. ©2014, Midwest Political Science Association.",,,2-s2.0-84907981979

Given the challenges of detecting emotions from contexts in which no lexical clue is present, in this article we present a comparative analysis between the performance of well-established methods for emotion detection (supervised and lexical knowledge-based) and a method we propose and extend, which is based on commonsense knowledge stored in the EmotiNet knowledge base.

In view of prevailing moral sentiments, some of these characteristics call for compensating transfers, and some do not. We study the literature on this problem of compensation. This literature follows the distinction between the ethical principle of compensation and that of responsibility. According to the former, a good resource allocation system should neutralize the differential influence over agents' outcomes of the characteristics that elicit compensation. According to the latter, a good resource allocation system should remain neutral with respect to inequality arising from the influence of characteristics that do not elicit compensation. The principle of responsibility can be interpreted as a libertarian principle of natural reward, or as a principle of utilitarian reward. Depending on whether the emphasis is put on the principle of compensation or of responsibility, and depending on how the latter is interpreted, there exist four main families of solutions to compensation problems. We review the axiomatic analyses of these four families of solutions in the different models in which they have been studied.

Or that music's aesthetic value derives from its deep structure? This study traces the widely employed trope of musical depth to its origins in German-language music criticism and analysis. From the Romantic aesthetics of E. T. A. Hoffmann to the modernist theories of Arnold Schoenberg, metaphors of depth attest to the cross-pollination of music with discourses ranging from theology, geology and poetics to psychology, philosophy and economics. The book demonstrates that the persistence of depth metaphors in musicology and music theory today is an outgrowth of their essential role in articulating and transmitting Germanic cultural values. While musical depth metaphors have historically served to communicate German nationalist sentiments, Watkins shows that an appreciation for the broad connotations of those metaphors opens up exciting new avenues for interpretation. © Holly Watkins 2011.",,,2-s2.0-84924722559

This information is usually presented as non-structured free-text so that automatically extracting and rating user opinions about a product is a challenging task. Moreover, this opinion highly depends on the product features on which the user judgments and impressions are expressed. Following this idea, our goal is to predict the overall rating of a product review based on the user opinion about the different product features that are evaluated in the review. To this end, the system first identifies the features that are relevant to consumers when evaluating a certain type of product, as well as the relative importance or salience of such features. The system then extracts from the review the user opinions about the different product features and quantifies such opinions. The salience of the different product features and the values that quantify the user opinions about them are used to construct a Vector of Feature Intensities which represents the review and will be the input to a machine learning model that classifies the review into different rating categories. Our method is evaluated over 1000 hotel reviews from booking.com. The results compare favorably with those achieved by other systems addressing similar evaluations. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.",Automatic product rating; Feature mining; Polarity detection; Sentiment analysis,,2-s2.0-85025077601

A recent fMRI study revealed that the right superior anterior temporal lobe (ATL) was activated irrespective of the context of moral feelings (guilt or indignation). This region has been associated with context-independent conceptual social knowledge which allows us to make fine-grained differentiations between qualities of social behaviours (e.g. ""critical"" and ""faultfinding""). This knowledge is required to make emotional evaluations of social behaviour. In contrast to the context-independent activation of the ATL, there were context-dependent activations within different fronto-mesolimbic regions for guilt and indignation. However, it is unknown whether functional integration occurs between these regions and whether regional patterns of integration are distinctive for the experience of different moral sentiments. Here, we used fMRI and psychophysiological interaction analysis, an established measure of functional integration to investigate this issue. We found selective functional integration between the right superior ATL and a subgenual cingulate region during the experience of guilt and between the right superior ATL and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex for indignation. Our data provide the first evidence for functional integration of conceptual social knowledge representations in the right superior ATL with representations of different feeling contexts in fronto-mesolimbic regions. We speculate that this functional architecture allows for the conceptually differentiated experience of moral sentiments in healthy individuals. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",Anger; Anterior temporal lobe; FMRI; Guilt; Indignation; Major depression; Moral emotions; Orbitofrontal cortex; Psychophysiological interaction; Semantics; Septal region; Subgenual cingulate cortex,adult; article; cingulate gyrus; controlled study; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; guilt; human; human experiment; limbic system; male; morality; normal human; orbital cortex; priority journal; temporal lobe; Attitude; Female; Frontal Lobe; Guilt; Humans; Limbic System; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Moral Development; Nerve Net; Neural Pathways; Temporal Lobe; Young Adult,2-s2.0-77954952593

This paper proposes an adapted information bottleneck method for the construction of domain-oriented sentiment lexicon. This approach can naturally make full use of the mutual reinforcement between documents and words by fusing three kinds of relationships either from words to documents or from words to words; either homogeneous or heterogeneous; either within-domain or cross-domain.

Thus, Latinos who use Spanish-language news may have a higher likelihood of possessing pro-immigrant sentiments than Latinos who only use English-language news. Content analysis of Spanish and English-language television news segments reveals variations in the tone and substance of these news outlets.

Despite the image today of Europeans as a rather sedentary and socially immobile population – particularly when compared to the highly mobile spatial and social patterns of North Americans – contemporary Europe has essentially emerged out of a crucible of local, regional, and international population movements over the centuries. In this chapter, I consider the crucial impact of migration in Europe on European identity, by building a bridge between historical analyses of the phenomenon and emerging patterns that are shaping Europe as a distinctive new regional space of migration and mobility. My contribution points to how migration is making and remaking Europe, less at the level of identity in people's heads – in fact, if anything, most migrations are contributing to the growth of anti-European sentiment – but more in a territorial and (especially) structural economic sense. This is less easy to see if a purely cultural view is taken of the question of Europe. After sketching the role of population movements in the making and unmaking of Europe historically, I explore in depth the three kinds of migration/mobility that are most salient to the continent today and its structural transformation: first, the ongoing, traditional “ethnic” immigration of non-Europeans into European nation-states; second, the small but symbolically important emergence of new intra-European “elite” migrations, engaged by European citizens enjoying the fruits of their EU free movement rights; and third, the politically ambiguous flows of East–West migrants – which fall somewhere between the other two forms – that have been connected to the EU enlargement processes formalized in 2004 and 2007. © Cambridge University Press 2009.",,,2-s2.0-84928076125

Building on this anti-French sentiment, George W. Bush's 2004 presidential campaign used narratives that cast Frenchness as feminine, assigning ""Frenchness"" to Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry - and thereby characterizing him as unfit for the White House. Specifically, political conservatives sought to strip Kerry of the masculine qualities perceived necessary to serve as president of the United States. Analysis of American political and media discourse from September 2002 to November 2004 shows that the 2004 presidential campaign came to be defined in substantial part by nationalistic and sexist political communications that capitalized upon and reinscribed patterns and norms of hegemonic masculinity while also feminizing and devaluing dissent in times of war.",Cultural resonance; Discourse analysis; Hegemonic masculinity; Presidential elections; U.S.-France relations; Wartime political discourse,,2-s2.0-34547339955

Most evaluation studies focus only on one type of outcome. This study evaluated outcomes on both primary and secondary targets of the Reasoning and Rehabilitation (R&R) program for 372 male Swedish prisoners. Method: Short-term changes were measured by the Sense of Coherence scale, Eysenck’s Impulsiveness, Venturesomeness and Empathy Questionnaire and the Criminal Sentiments Scale. Long-term changes were measured by reconviction outcomes compared to matched controls. Results: The total program completion rate was 77% over a five-year period. Primary target evaluation showed significant pro-social short-term improvements among program completers in sense of coherence, impulsiveness, venturesomeness, attitudes towards the law, courts and police, tolerance of law violation and criminal identification. Secondary target evaluation by survival analysis showed that program completers had a 25% lower risk of reconviction up to 36 months following prison release, compared to matched controls. Dropouts, who were younger and more criminally active, had a 38% higher comparative risk of reconviction. Significant differences occurred in overall 36-month reconviction rates: 48.1% for program completers (n = 212), 60.3% for controls (n = 451) and 73.4% for dropouts (n = 64). Conclusions: The R&R program was associated with positive shortand long-term results. Future research should expand test batteries to assess-ment of cognitive and social skill acquisition and measurement ofmotivation for change, as well as randomizing study participants to investigate a possible selection bias in the present results. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

The fact that such exploration often is intrinsically related to political and social factors characterizing the society out of which it originates is consequently obscured, if not entirely neglected. This paper attempts to demonstrate that the genesis and the very purpose of the Great Siberian Expedition cannot be understood apart from the political and ideological climate of the 1840s and 1850s in Russia. It shows that the rapid and powerful growth of nationalist sentiment at this time was the main inspiration for the work of the young Russian Geographical Society. This sentiment dictated the exclusive task for geographers to study the Russian fatherland and, more specifically, it lent a special imperative to the study of Russian Asia. Members of the Society came to see this latter endeavor as a means for them to fulfill their patriotic responsibilities. Russia's acquisition of the Amur and Ussuri regions in the 1850s became closely associated with the general nationalist movement for Russia's renovation and resurrection, and thus geographical exploration of the terra incognita of southeastern Siberia offered a perfect opportunity for the members of the Geographical Society, in their unique capacity as geographers, to consummate actively their devotion to this cause. It is further suggested that the Great Siberian Expedition is not unique in its responsiveness to prevailing political sentiments and needs, but rather that this pattern is characteristic for much of geographical exploration, both in Russia and elsewhere. A more detailed consideration of these interrelationships in the history of exploration will lead to a deeper and more nearly complete understanding of the subject. © 1983 Taylor & Francis Group All right reserved.",Amur; Asiatic Russia; Far East; history of exploration; history of geography; nationalism; Russian Geographical Society,Amur; Asiatic Russia; Far East; history of exploration; history of geography; nationalism; Russian Geographical Society.,2-s2.0-0021057716

A novel term similarity measure (PMI-TFIDF) is introduced to evaluate the association of candidate features and domain entities. The results show that our approach of feature extraction outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, and the only external resources used are comparative domain corpora. Therefore, it is generic and unsupervised. Compared with traditional pointwise mutual information (PMI), PMI-TFIDF showed better distinction ability. We also propose feature-oriented opinion determination based on feature-opinion pair extraction and feature-oriented opinion lexicon generation.

Opinions and the emotions that are embedded in them, play a key role in decision-making processes, with different effects depending on the negative or positive valence of the mood. When the choice depends on some important features (i.e., time, money, reliability/efficacy, etc.) and on other opinions (which come from previous experience), could be crucial to make the best decision. Inferring opinions and emotions enclosed in the written language is a complex task which cannot rely on body languages (posture, gestures, vocal inflections), rather than discovering concepts with an affective valence. The role of opinions extracted by the social content is crucial to support consumers' decision process; in addition, thanks opinions and emotions, it is possible to evidence improvements on existing decision supports and show how the opinion-mining techniques can be incorporated into these systems. This paper presents a tentative contribution that addresses this issue: it introduces a framework for extracting the emotions and the sentiments expressed in the textual data. The sentiments are expressed by a positive or negative polarity, the emotions are based on the Minsky's conception of emotions, that consists of four affective dimensions, each one with six levels of activations [1]. Sentiments and emotions are modeled as fuzzy sets; particularly, the intensity of the emotions has been tuned by fuzzy modifiers, which act on the linguistic patterns recognized in the sentences. The approach has been tested on some sets of documents categories, revealing interesting performance on the global framework processing. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, the number of documents available online and offline is increasing dramatically, and preprocessed text data have more features. This development makes analysis more complex to be analyzed effectively. This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised Laplacian eigenmap (SS-LE). The SS-LE removes redundant features effectively by decreasing detection errors of sentiments. Moreover, it enables visualization of documents in perceptible low dimensional embedded space to provide a useful tool for text analytics. The proposed method is evaluated using multi-domain review data set in sentiment visualization and classification by comparing other dimensionality reduction methods. SS-LE provides a better similarity measure in the visualization result by separating positive and negative documents properly. Sentiment classification models trained over reduced data by SS-LE show higher accuracy. Overall, experimental results suggest that SS-LE has the potential to be used to visualize documents for the ease of analysis and to train a predictive model in sentiment analysis.

It presents a comprehensive review of software tools for social networking media, wikis, really simple syndication feeds, blogs, newsgroups, chat and news feeds. For completeness, it also includes introductions to social media scraping, storage, data cleaning and sentiment analysis. Although principally a review, the paper also provides a methodology and a critique of social media tools. Analyzing social media, in particular Twitter feeds for sentiment analysis, has become a major research and business activity due to the availability of web-based application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by Twitter, Facebook and News services. This has led to an ‘explosion’ of data services, software tools for scraping and analysis and social media analytics platforms. It is also a research area undergoing rapid change and evolution due to commercial pressures and the potential for using social media data for computational (social science) research. Using a simple taxonomy, this paper provides a review of leading software tools and how to use them to scrape, cleanse and analyze the spectrum of social media. In addition, it discussed the requirement of an experimental computational environment for social media research and presents as an illustration the system architecture of a social media (analytics) platform built by University College London. The principal contribution of this paper is to provide an overview (including code fragments) for scientists seeking to utilize social media scraping and analytics either in their research or business. The data retrieval techniques that are presented in this paper are valid at the time of writing this paper (June 2014), but they are subject to change since social media data scraping APIs are rapidly changing. © 2014, The Author(s).",Behavior economics; NLP; Opinion mining; Scraping; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Software platforms; Toolkits,Application programming interfaces (API); Behavioral research; Computer software; Data mining; Digital storage; Social sciences; Social sciences computing; NLP; Opinion mining; Scraping; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Software platforms; Toolkits; Social networking (online),2-s2.0-84922001946

The large scale of these online communities makes it impossible for the moderators to engage in all conversations; yet, some conversations need their expertise. Our work explores low-cost text classification methods to this new domain of determining whether a thread in an online health forum needs moderators' help. Methods: We employed a binary classifier on WebMD's online diabetes community data. To train the classifier, we considered three feature types: (1) word unigram, (2) sentiment analysis features, and (3) thread length. We applied feature selection methods based on χ2 statistics and under sampling to account for unbalanced data. We then performed a qualitative error analysis to investigate the appropriateness of the gold standard. Results: Using sentiment analysis features, feature selection methods, and balanced training data increased the AUC value up to 0.75 and the F1-score up to 0.54 compared to the baseline of using word unigrams with no feature selection methods on unbalanced data (0.65 AUC and 0.40 F1-score). The error analysis uncovered additional reasons for why moderators respond to patients' posts. Discussion: We showed how feature selection methods and balanced training data can improve the overall classification performance. We present implications of weighing precision versus recall for assisting moderators of online health communities. Our error analysis uncovered social, legal, and ethical issues around addressing community members' needs. We also note challenges in producing a gold standard, and discuss potential solutions for addressing these challenges. Conclusion: Social media environments provide popular venues in which patients gain health-related information. Our work contributes to understanding scalable solutions for providing moderators' expertise in these large-scale, social media environments. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Consumer health; Health information seeking; Human-computer interaction; Online health communities; Text mining,Classification performance; Consumer healths; Feature selection methods; Health informations; On-line communities; Online health communities; Text classification methods; Text mining; Data mining; Error analysis; Gold; Health; Human computer interaction; Moderators; Sampling; Text processing; Classification (of information); accuracy; article; classification; classifier; conversation; diabetes mellitus; gold standard; information processing; medical information system; medical society; online system; performance; priority journal; qualitative analysis; training; Consumer health; Health information seeking; Human-computer interaction; Online health communities; Text mining; Internet; Social Support; Text Messaging,2-s2.0-84888203672

Use of data from social networks for different purposes, such as election prediction, sentimental analysis, marketing, communication, business, and education, is increasing day by day. Precise extraction of valuable information from short text messages posted on social media (Twitter) is a collaborative task. In this paper, we analyze tweets to classify data and sentiments from Twitter more precisely. The information from tweets are extracted using keyword based knowledge extraction. Moreover, the extracted knowledge is further enhanced using domain specific seed based enrichment technique. The proposed methodology facilitates the extraction of keywords, entities, synonyms, and parts of speech from tweets which are then used for tweets classification and sentimental analysis. The proposed system is tested on a collection of 40,000 tweets. The proposed methodology has performed better than the existing system in terms of tweets classification and sentiment analysis. By applying the Knowledge Enhancer and Synonym Binder module on the extracted information we have achieved increase in information gain in a range of 0.1% to 55%.

This method is targeted towards the web-based applications that deal with noisy, unstructured text, like the tweets, and cannot afford to use heavy linguistic resources like parsing due to frequent failure of the parsers to handle noisy data. Most of the works in micro-blogs, like Twitter, use a bag-of-words model that ignores the discourse particles like but, since, although etc. In this work, we show how the discourse relations like the connectives and conditionals can be used to incorporate discourse information in any bag-of-words model, to improve sentiment classification accuracy. We also probe the influence of the semantic operators like modals and negations on the discourse relations that affect the sentiment of a sentence. Discourse relations and corresponding rules are identified with minimal processing - just a list look up. We first give a linguistic description of the various discourse relations which leads to conditions in rules and features in SVM. We show that our discourse-based bag-of-words model performs well in a noisy medium (Twitter), where it performs better than an existing Twitter-based application. Furthermore, we show that our approach is beneficial to structured reviews as well, where we achieve a better accuracy than a state-of-the-art system in the travel review domain.

Additionally, little attention has been directed towards a finer analysis of human moods and affective states. Motivated by research in psychology, we propose and develop a classifier of several human affective states in social media. Starting with about 200 moods, we utilize mechanical turk studies to derive naturalistic signals from posts shared on Twitter about a variety of affects of individuals. This dataset is then deployed in an affect classification task with promising results. Our findings indicate that different types of affect involve different emotional content and usage styles; hence the performance of the classifier on various affects can differ considerably.

The challenge of designing accurate classifiers for ordinal regression generally increases with the number of classes involved, due to the large number of labeled patterns that are needed. The availability of ordinal class labels, however, is often costly to calibrate or difficult to obtain. Unlabeled patterns, on the other hand, often exist in much greater abundance and are freely available. To take benefits from the abundance of unlabeled patterns, we present a novel transductive learning paradigm for ordinal regression in this paper, namely transductive ordinal regression (TOR). The key challenge of this paper lies in the precise estimation of both the ordinal class label of the unlabeled data and the decision functions of the ordinal classes, simultaneously. The core elements of the proposed TOR include an objective function that caters to several commonly used loss functions casted in transductive settings, for general ordinal regression. A label swapping scheme that facilitates a strictly monotonic decrease in the objective function value is also introduced. Extensive numerical studies on commonly used benchmark datasets including the real-world sentiment prediction problem are then presented to showcase the characteristics and efficacies of the proposed TOR. Further, comparisons to recent state-of-the-art ordinal regression methods demonstrate the introduced transductive learning paradigm for ordinal regression led to the robust and improved performance. © 2012 IEEE.",Cluster assumption; ordinal classification; ordinal loss function; ordinal regression (OR); support vector machines (SVMs); transductive learning,Cluster assumptions; Loss functions; Ordinal classification; Ordinal regression; Support vector machine (SVMs); Transductive learning; Support vector machines; Regression analysis,2-s2.0-84876943494

Automated tools have emerged to facilitate this analysis, however most lack the capability of extracting the relationships between the reviews' rich expressions and the customer ratings. Managers and marketers often resort to manually read through voluminous reviews to find the relationships. To address these challenges, we propose the development of a new class of BI systems based on rough set theory, inductive rule learning, and information retrieval methods. We developed a new framework for designing BI systems that extract the relationship between the customer ratings and their reviews. Using reviews of different products from Amazon.com, we conducted both qualitative and quantitative experiments to evaluate the performance of a BI system developed based on the framework.

These processes cannot be accurately be described by Orientalist terms such as 'Arab Spring', 'Arab unrest' or the 'Facebook Revolution', where such categorizations fail to account for the radical transformation in politics and values that the Arab World is undergoing and the significance that resides in the confluence of social and democratic demands. The ultimate fate of these popular uprisings remains in the balance, but it is all too clear that they have produced the most dramatic changes in the region since the mid-twentieth century which marked the end of the colonial era.

According to our observation on five million tweets, these emotion tokens are commonly used (0.47 emotion tokens per tweet). They directly express one's emotion regardless of his language; hence become a useful signal for sentiment analysis on multilingual tweets. Firstly, emotion tokens are extracted automatically from tweets. Secondly, a graph propagation algorithm is proposed to label the tokens' polarities.

Protesters were motivated by strong grievances, for they had an especially negative evaluation of race relations. Yet they were also motivated by optimism about the prospects of success, for they believed that there was no white majority for strict segregation. The analysis underscores the importance of beliefs and sentiments, which cannot easily be reduced to objective measures of social location. © Mobilization: An International Journal.",,,2-s2.0-33749685318

I argue that the conventional explanations that treat this instance of collective violence either as spontaneous rioting caused by over-excited masses or as a government conspiracy that eventually got out of control are insufficient in that they fail to answer how and why so many people participated in these riots When we know that nothing on this scale ever took place in the history of the republic. In order to adequately understand the dynamics behind these riots one first needs to situate them in the broader historical context of the emergence, development and crystallisation of Turkish nationalism and national identity that marked the non-Muslim citizens of the republic as the 'others' and potential enemies of the real Turkish nation. This historical analysis constitutes the first part of the article. Since ethno-national riots do not always occur whenever there are conflicting identities, one also needs to explain the processes through which ethno-national identities become radicalized and polarized. Thus, in the second part of the article, I focus on the economic, political and social conditions of the post-single-party era (post-1950) that helped to radicalise the sentiments of the growing urban populace against the non-Muslim 'others'. I argue that it was the socio-economic, ideological and political transformations of the Democrat Party era that made it possible for ethnic entrepreneurs and state provocateurs to mobilise the masses against a fictitious enemy. © ASEN 2005.",,historical perspective; nationalism; religion; violence; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Turkey; World,2-s2.0-22144486267

Investigation of this issue is of interest since the level of trading activity may contain information about the sentiment and the future direction of the prices in the market. Several important conclusions emerge from this analysis. It is found that price changes are useful in predicting trading volume, which suggests that higher capital gains encourage more transactions in the market. Additionally, it seems that volume has a negative impact on the volatility of price changes. More specifically, in contrast to what is reported for financial markets, we find evidence that, in the market for ships, increases in trading activity lead to a reduction in market volatility. This can be explained by the unique underlying characteristics of the market for ships, including thin trading, which imply that increases in trading activity result in price transparency and stability. These findings indicate that practitioners in the market may use the information contained in the level of trading activity so as to guide their market decisions in the sale and purchase market.",,bulk cargo; freight transport; price dynamics; shipping; transportation economics,2-s2.0-0742301783

Whilst not all of Putin's reforms have been implemented fully, the reorganisation of the Federation Council, his usurpation of unilateral powers to dismiss regional assemblies and chief executives, combined with his creation of seven federal districts, make a mockery of federalism. There are real worries that Putin's quest for a 'dictatorship of law' will be bought at the cost of civil liberties and the consolidation of democracy. At present it would appear that Putin is willing to sacrifice democracy in order to win unity. However, his attack on the sovereignty claims of the ethnic republics are surely just as likely to stir up nationist sentiments as to quell them. © 2003 The Regents of the University of California.

The substantive issue involves the public's deep ambivalence toward government reforms. Americans are simultaneously supportive of significant reform and uneasy about expanding government involvement. The critical question is what, if any, impact this public ambivalence will have on policy deliberations. Answering this question requires an analysis of the role of public opinion in policy-making. Investigation of historic as well as contemporary health reform suggests that the impact of public opinion varies, depending on the character of both public opinion and the policy issue. The public's preferences are not especially influential when they are characterized by uncertainty or when an issue is not salient, but strong and sustained sentiment can affect agenda setting, interest group leverage over government officials, and policymakers' formulation of detailed administrative arrangements.",,government; health care access; health care financing; health care planning; health care policy; health care system; human; national health insurance; public opinion; review; tax; united states; Attitude; Attitude to Health; Government; Health Care Reform; Lobbying; Policy Making; Politics; Public Opinion; United States,2-s2.0-0027504427

My argument is that closer attention must be paid to labour market relations in trying to explain both the anti-Arab sentiments of Oriental Jews and their proclivity for right-wing politics. Oriental Jews compete with both citizen and non-citizen Palestinians for jobs at the lowest end of the occupational ladder. This competition, I argue, can explain a great deal of their political attitudes. The data to support the argument are derived from an attitude survey conducted in 1988 in eight ‘development towns’ - small working-class communities populated mainly with Orientals and characterized by high unemployment rates and pervasive social and economic ills. These towns, and the sociologically similar slum neighbourhoods of major cities, provided Rabbi Meir Kahane, Israel's most vociferously racist politician, with the bulk of his electoral support when he was elected to the Knesset in 1984. In 1988 I found support for Kahane in development towns was almost three times as high as it was in 1984. (Kahane was barred from running for the Knesset in 1988 for being a racist.) Analysis of the data showed that this support was disproportionately concentrated among mrespondents who suffered most from the effects of labour market friction with Palestinian workers. © 1990, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Gager J.G.,"Body-symbols and social reality: Resurrection, incarnation and asceticism in early Christianity",1982,Religion,25,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-49049142672&doi=10.1016%2f0048-721X%2882%2990054-9&partnerID=40&md5=95aa0e9a0af50895524cdc25813ac2be,"Mary Douglas has invited historians of religion to test her hypothesis about the social meaning of body symbols. Her view that body symbolism always points in the direction of social concerns and that efforts to separate body and spirit indicate sentiments of revolt and alienation has proved fruitful in several areas. Of course there is nothing particularly novel in the proposal that the body can be seen as a symbol of wider realities. The Stoics spoke of the universe as a body; Paul could describe individual Christian congregations as a body; and Priscillian referred to the human body in depreciating terms as a figura mundi. Victor Turner has shown that the body symbols of the Ndembu in Zambia are part of a wider pattern which uses 'an aspect of human physiology as a model for social, cosmic and religious ideas and processes', including, he adds, 'the human body [as] ... a microcosm of the universe,'57 There is even a considerable literature on the subject.58 Indeed, one cannot help but be struck by the fact that with the great abundance of work devoted to body symbols in general, so little has been done with early Christianity. What distinguishes Douglas from other theoreticians of body symbolism is her Durkheimian orientation. By taking seriously the social dimension of body symbols and by positing the revolutionary character of symbols which separate body and spirit, she is able to uncover latent dimensions of doctrinal controversy and to restore flesh to the dry bones of theological debate. In her own preliminary studies, she has limited herself to one symbol, i.e. incarnation, and one controversy, i.e. the Arian. In extending her initiative to other symbols and controversies, I have proceeded on the assumption that body symbols of different sorts should reflect the same condensed message about society. I would argue that this effort has been largely successful. Expectations of imminent resurrection or views of the resurrection which deny the physical aspect are regularly associated in early Christianity with separatist-sectarian behaviour generally. The recession of hopes for an imminent resurrection accompanied the transition of Christianity from sect to church. Conversely, and this would warrant further study, subsequent sectarian movements within Christianity seem to be accompanied by a return of hopes for physical resurrection. Particular sorts of sectarianism, especially those which stress individualism and spiritualism, are prone to view the resurrection in other than physical terms. Even the mainstream of Christianity refused to abandon altogether the doctrine of a future resurrection. Orthodox believers could always point to the denial of resurrection as an unmistakable signpost of heresy. At one level we may treat this doctrinal survival as little more than a memory of Christianity's sectarian pedigree, as a vaguely disquieting memory. At another level, however, its very survival, against heavy odds, may also be seen as a permanent symbolic indicator of Christianity's ultimate refusal to identify itself completely with the secular order. Beyond this, the survival of belief in resurrection has meant the persistence of a latent symbol of protest, alienation and transformation. For in the final analysis, it is not the case that symbols merely reflect social reality. As symbols, they also possess the power to shape it. In this observation lies perhaps an explanation for the fact that our effort has not been fully successful. We have not found it to be true in every case that statements of protest in one symbolic medium, say, asceticism, will inevitably be replicated in other media, say, incarnation and resurrection. This does occur often enough to be interesting and more than coincidental. The Testimony of Truth from Nag Hammadi is a paradigm case. Paul's Corinthians, Paul himself and Arius come close. The ascetics of Egypt are the most interesting 'deviants'. The connection between their asceticism and the message of alienation and protest is clear. Their views of the resurrection have not been much studied, but in view of the symbolic function of their bodies and their view of ascetic practice as a means of restoring the natural state of Eden, it is not too much to suggest that their conception of resurrection would have emphasized the restored and purified nature of the resurrection body in contrast to the orthodox view of the absolute identity of that body with the present physical one. As for their views of the incarnation, there is some evidence of leanings in this direction. While those who held to docetic christologies generally favoured asceticism, the reverse was not always true. Part of the reason for the absence of docetic views of the incarnation among the ascetics-assuming, of course, that they should have been docetists-is that they say so little about doctrines of any kind. Part may also be due to the orthodoxy of those who wrote about the monks. Part may be due to the fact that the primary target of ascetic protest was not the physical universe, or matter as such, or even the world of social and political reality, but rather the church in and of the world-a differentiated and thus moderated protest. But part may also be due to a more or less conscious decision to draw a line between expressions of alienation, so to speak, a symbolic quid pro quo. The quid was the recognition by the church at large that ascetic piety could not be proscribed by the successor generations of the martyrs. The pro quo would then take the form of doctrinal orthodoxy. Thus the absence of docetic christologies among the ascetics would result not just from the imposition of episcopal authority but from the power of doctrine to shape reality. Body symbols thus provide us with a new thread for tracing the transformation of Christianity from an obscure cluster of sects in Palestine to an institution of unparalleled spiritual and political power in the Roman empire. Of course, not everyone accepted this transformation as an act of divine providence. Some reacted by denying that God had taken on a human body in the person of Jesus; others tortured their bodies; and from time to time in succeeding centuries still others gathered in small communities to await the resurrection of the body and with it the birth of a new world. © 1982.",,,2-s2.0-49049142672

Factor analysis revealed four readily interpretable dimensions of conservatism among the whites (family and motherhood, religious factor, racial factor, and radical counterculture factor), but only two clearly interpretable factors among the Indians (religious factor, radical counterculture factor). The anticipated greater conservatism of the Indians did not appear; their cumulative conservatism scores were comparable to those of whites. The correlation between conservatism and support for Indian assimilation was positive, and stronger for whites than for Indians. There was a racial difference in the relation between conservatism and racial intolerance; among whites the conservatives were most likely to give intolerant responses about Indians, but among Indians there was no relationship between conservatism and antiwhite sentiments.

Population growth may occur faster or slower than expected, regulations may change, and public sentiment can shift. In the face of these uncertainties, water system managers must plan for large infrastructure investments and the questions about when it is desirable to invest in infrastructure and what is the appropriate infrastructure component size to meet growing demands. One of the most powerful and intuitive ways to incorporate uncertainties is to use scenarios that represent plausible futures. Scenario-based planning is gaining acceptance in the water resources community. Preparing for a range of possible futures provides flexibility and adds robustness to the system so it can respond to uncertain events at reasonable costs while maintaining community confidence in their utilities. In this paper, novel scenario-based planning and optimization approaches are presented for the optimal design of regional-scale water supply infrastructure in a multiperiod planning framework. For demonstration, water demand projections are considered as uncertain and multiperiod construction projects are selected to minimize the economic costs. The solution approaches are applied to a decentralized water reclamation planning project in a green-field development area in southeast Tucson, Arizona, where water reclamation is viewed as a potential component for a sustainable water supply. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Multistage construction; Robust optimization; Scenario planning; Uncertainty; Water supply,Optimization; Population statistics; Uncertainty analysis; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Water resources; Water supply; Decentralized water reclamations; Infrastructure investment; Robust optimization; Scenario Planning; Sustainable water supply; Uncertainty; Water demand projections; Water supply infrastructures; Investments; infrastructure planning; optimization; sustainability; uncertainty analysis; water demand; water planning; water resource; water supply; Arizona; Tucson; United States,2-s2.0-84896073722

Social media offers opportunities for people to share opinions and experiences freely in online communities, which may contribute information beyond the knowledge of domain professionals. This paper describes the development of a novel semantic web platform called PREDOSE ( PREscription Drug abuse Online Surveillance and Epidemiology), which is designed to facilitate the epidemiologic study of prescription (and related) drug abuse practices using social media. PREDOSE uses web forum posts and domain knowledge, modeled in a manually created Drug Abuse Ontology (DAO - pronounced dow), to facilitate the extraction of semantic information from User Generated Content (UGC), through combination of lexical, pattern-based and semantics-based techniques. In a previous study, PREDOSE was used to obtain the datasets from which new knowledge in drug abuse research was derived. Here, we report on various platform enhancements, including an updated DAO, new components for relationship and triple extraction, and tools for content analysis, trend detection and emerging patterns exploration, which enhance the capabilities of the PREDOSE platform. Given these enhancements, PREDOSE is now more equipped to impact drug abuse research by alleviating traditional labor-intensive content analysis tasks. Methods: Using custom web crawlers that scrape UGC from publicly available web forums, PREDOSE first automates the collection of web-based social media content for subsequent semantic annotation. The annotation scheme is modeled in the DAO, and includes domain specific knowledge such as prescription (and related) drugs, methods of preparation, side effects, and routes of administration. The DAO is also used to help recognize three types of data, namely: (1) entities, (2) relationships and (3) triples. PREDOSE then uses a combination of lexical and semantic-based techniques to extract entities and relationships from the scraped content, and a top-down approach for triple extraction that uses patterns expressed in the DAO. In addition, PREDOSE uses publicly available lexicons to identify initial sentiment expressions in text, and then a probabilistic optimization algorithm (from related research) to extract the final sentiment expressions. Together, these techniques enable the capture of fine-grained semantic information, which facilitate search, trend analysis and overall content analysis using social media on prescription drug abuse. Moreover, extracted data are also made available to domain experts for the creation of training and test sets for use in evaluation and refinements in information extraction techniques. Results: A recent evaluation of the information extraction techniques applied in the PREDOSE platform indicates 85% precision and 72% recall in entity identification, on a manually created gold standard dataset. In another study, PREDOSE achieved 36% precision in relationship identification and 33% precision in triple extraction, through manual evaluation by domain experts. Given the complexity of the relationship and triple extraction tasks and the abstruse nature of social media texts, we interpret these as favorable initial results. Extracted semantic information is currently in use in an online discovery support system, by prescription drug abuse researchers at the Center for Interventions, Treatment and Addictions Research (CITAR) at Wright State University. Conclusion: A comprehensive platform for entity, relationship, triple and sentiment extraction from such abstruse texts has never been developed for drug abuse research. PREDOSE has already demonstrated the importance of mining social media by providing data from which new findings in drug abuse research were uncovered. Given the recent platform enhancements, including the refined DAO, components for relationship and triple extraction, and tools for content, trend and emerging pattern analysis, it is expected that PREDOSE will play a significant role in advancing drug abuse epidemiology in future. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Drug Abuse Ontology; Entity identification; Opiod abuse; Prescription drug abuse; Relationship extraction; Semantic web; Sentiment extraction; Social media; Triple extraction,Drug abuse; Entity identification; Opiod abuse; Prescription drug abuse; Relationship extraction; Social media; Algorithms; Data mining; Data processing; Diseases; Drug interactions; Epidemiology; Information retrieval; Research; Semantic Web; Semantics; Tools; Social networking (online); buprenorphine plus naloxone; phenobarbital; accuracy; algorithm; article; book; clinical evaluation; coding; content analysis; data analysis; data extraction; device recall; drug abuse; drug misuse; entity extraction; geography; gold standard; human; medical research; prescription drug abuse online surveillance and epidemiology; priority journal; relationship extraction; semantics; sentiment extraction; social media; trend study; triple extraction; web browser; Drug Abuse Ontology; Entity identification; Opiod abuse; Prescription drug abuse; Relationship extraction; Semantic web; Sentiment extraction; Social media; Triple extraction; Humans; Internet; Social Media; Substance-Related Disorders,2-s2.0-84888198547

Furthermore, we show that using out-of-the-box classification tools results in a poor performance, and instead develop a highly optimized multi-stage approach designed for general-purpose political sentiment classification. Finally, we compare the change in sentiment detected in our dataset before and after 19 Republican debates, concluding that, at least in this case, the Twitter political chatter is not indicative of national political polls. © 2013 ACM.",political discourse; sentiment analysis; social media,Classification tool; Multistage approach; News media; Political campaign; Political discourse; Poor performance; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Social media; Systematic analysis; Data mining; Information retrieval; Social sciences; World Wide Web; Social networking (online),2-s2.0-84874234357

Two tasks were proposed: a profiling task, where tweets had to be annotated for relevance and polarity for reputation, and a monitoring task, where tweets had to be clustered thematically and clusters had to be ordered by priority (for reputation management purposes). The gold standard consisted of annotations made by reputation management experts, a feature which turns the RepLab 2012 test collection in a useful source not only to evaluate systems, but also to reach a better understanding of the notions of polarity and priority in the context of reputation management.",Evaluation methodologies and metrics; RepLab; Reputation management; Sentiment analysis; Test collections; Text clustering,Social networking (online); Evaluation methodologies; RepLab; Reputation management; Sentiment analysis; Test Collection; Text Clustering; Online systems,2-s2.0-84922032630

One of these aspects is negation, which can be accounted for in various ways. We compare several approaches to accounting for negation in sentiment analysis, differing in their methods of determining the scope of influence of a negation keyword. On a set of English movie review sentences, the best approach is to consider two words, following a negation keyword, to be negated by that keyword. This method yields a significant increase in overall sentiment classification accuracy and macro-level F 1 of 5.5% and 6.2%, respectively, compared to not accounting for negation. Additionally optimizing sentiment modification of negated words to a value of -1.27 rather than -1 yields a significant 7.1% increase in accuracy and a significant 8.0% increase in macro-level F 1. © 2011 IEEE.",negation scope; negation strength; Sentiment analysis,Decision makers; Key elements; negation scope; negation strength; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Word frequencies; Cybernetics; Data mining,2-s2.0-83755163914

The main advantages of this method over existing methods are resource efficiency and task specificity. We conduct experiments in the area of cross-language topic and sentiment classification involving English as source language and German, French, and Japanese as target languages. The results show a significant improvement of the proposed method over a machine translation baseline, reducing the relative error due to cross-lingual adaptation by an average of 30% (topic classification) and 59% (sentiment classification).

For vlog search, we present saliency-based matching to simulate human perception of similarity, and organize the results by personalized ranking and category-based clustering. An evaluation criterion is also proposed for vlog annotation, which assigns a score to an annotation according to its accuracy and completeness in representing the vlog's semantics.

The research is mainly limited to an analysis of nuclear allergy as political metaphor. This metaphor was used most predominantly in the late 1960s to brand opponents of Japan's nuclearization as ‘allergic’. By locating antinuclear sentiments in the medical context of disease, those trying to nuclearize Japan were able to invoke the entailment of the need for a ‘cure’. A gradual increase in the number of nuclear-powered (and undoubtedly nuclear-weapon loaded) U.S. ships and submarines making port calls to Japan, criticism of the antinuclear sentiments from the viewpoint of ‘international common sense’, and the initiation of a propaganda campaign, were used to try to ‘cure’ the Japanese people's antinuclear ‘allergy’. The metaphor functions by transferring the image of ‘harmlessness’ associated with an allergen to nuclear weapons and by transferring the image of ‘abnormal’ associated with a reaction to an allergen to those Japanese opposed to nuclear weapons. Four conclusions are drawn: 1. the metaphor played an important role in structuring political reality; 2. labelling opponents as ‘allergic’ undermined the democratic discourse; 3. analyzing the inner workings of a metaphor can expose its manipulative power; 4. peace researchers, educators and activists need to exercise care in the use of metaphors and help to promulgate countermetaphors useful for denuclearization. © 1984, Sage Publications.

Our approach is directly inspired by the theory on domain adaptation suggesting that, for effective domain transfer to be achieved, predictions must be made based on features that cannot discriminate between the training (source) and test (target) domains. The approach implements this idea in the context of neural network architectures that are trained on labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled target-domain data is necessary). As the training progresses, the approach promotes the emergence of features that are (i) discriminative for the main learning task on the source domain and (ii) indiscriminate with respect to the shift between the domains. We show that this adaptation behaviour can be achieved in almost any feed-forward model by augmenting it with few standard layers and a new gradient reversal layer. The resulting augmented architecture can be trained using standard backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent, and can thus be implemented with little effort using any of the deep learning packages. We demonstrate the success of our approach for two distinct classification problems (document sentiment analysis and image classification), where state-of-the-art domain adaptation performance on standard benchmarks is achieved.

The framework effectively leverages rich social media content and quantifies the text using various automatically extracted signal cues. These extracted signal cues can then be used as modeling inputs for product defect discovery. We showcase the usefulness of the framework by performing product defect discovery using UGC in both the automotive and the consumer electronics domains. We use principal component analysis and logistic regression to produce a multivariate explanatory analysis relating defects to quantitative measures derived from text. For our samples, we find that a selection of distinctive terms, product features, and semantic factors are strong indicators of defects, whereas stylistic, social, and sentiment features are not. For high sales volume products, we demonstrate that significant corporate value is derivable from a reduction in defect discovery time and consequently defective product units in circulation. © 2014 Production and Operations Management Society.",quality management; social media analytics,,2-s2.0-84931324815

We have witnessed live reporting of many events, from soccer games in Johannesburg to revolutions in Cairo and Tunis, and these reports have in many ways rivaled the content provided by the official media. Tapping into this valuable resource is a challenge, due to the heterogeneity and noise inherent in realtime text, diversity of languages, and fast-evolving linguistic norms. In this paper we seek to analyze a tweet stream to automatically discover points in time when an important event happens, and to classify such events based on the type of the sentiments they evoke, using only non-textual features of the tweeting pattern. This results not only in a robust way of analyzing tweet streams independent of the languages used; it also provides insights about how users behave on social media websites. For example, we observe that users often react to an exciting external event by decreasing the volume of communication with other users. We explain this effect through a model of how users switch between producing information or sentiments and sharing others' news or sentiments. We develop and evaluate our models and algorithms using several Twitter data sets, focusing in particular on the tweets sent during the soccer World Cup of 2010. This data set has the feature that the underlying ground truth is welldefined and known whereby goals serve as events.

We modeled the polarity detection problem as a sequential classification task over streams of tweets. A Markovian formulation of the Support Vector Machine discriminative model as embodied by the SVMhmm algorithm has been here employed to assign the sentiment polarity to entire sequences. The experimental evaluation proves that sequential tagging effectively embodies evidence about the contexts and is able to reach a relative increment in detection accuracy of around 20% in F1 measure.

Starting from a hierarchical compositional method for generating sentence ratings, we expand the model by adding multi-word terms that can capture non-compositional semantics. The method operates similarly to a bigram language model, using bigram terms or backing off to unigrams based on a (degree of) compositionality criterion. The affective ratings for {\rm n}-gram terms of different orders are estimated via a corpus-based method using distributional semantic similarity metrics between unseen words and a set of seed words. {\rm N}-gram ratings are then combined into sentence ratings via simple algebraic formulas. The proposed framework produces state-of-the-art results for word-level tasks in English and German and the sentence-level news headlines classification SemEval'07-Task14 task.

The approach contains three steps: representing textual data as feature vectors, using ARIMA to analyze the linear part and developing a SVR model based only on textual feature vector to model the nonlinear part. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, quarterly ROEs (Return of Equity) of six security companies are chosen as the forecasting targets.

Based upon an analysis of over two million MySpace public comments associated with 2,990 pairs of U.K. and U.S. Friends using a sentiment detection program, statistically significant evidence was found for a weak correlation between the strength of positive emotion exchanged between Friends and received by Friends.

In order to analyze quantum processes physicist moved to a Probabilistic Cartesian System in which the causality principle became a probabilistic one. This means the trajectories of particles (obeying quantum rules) can be described only with the concept of cloudy wave packets. The approach to the brain-body-mind problem requires more than the prerequisite of modern physics and quantum dynamics. In the analysis of the brain-body-mind construct we have to include uncertain causalities and consequently multiple uncertain causalities. These multiple causalities originate from (1) nonlinear properties of the vegetative system (e.g. irregularities in biochemical transmitters, cardiac output, turbulences in the vascular system, respiratory apnea, nonlinear oscillatory interactions in peristalsis); (2) nonlinear behavior of the neuronal electricity (e.g. chaotic behavior measured by EEG), (3) genetic modulations, and (4) additional to these physiological entities nonlinear properties of physical processes in the body. The brain shows deterministic chaos with a correlation dimension of approx. D2 = 6, the smooth muscles approx. D2 = 3. According to these facts we propose a hyper-probabilistic approach or a hyper-probabilistic Cartesian System to describe and analyze the processes in the brain-body-mind system. If we add aspects as our sentiments, emotions and creativity to this construct, better said to this already hyper-probabilistic construct, this ""New Cartesian System"" is more than hyper-probabilistic, it is a nebulous system, we can predict the future only in a nebulous way; however, despite this chain of reasoning we can still provide predictions on brain-body-mind incorporations. We tentatively assume that the processes or mechanisms of the brain-body-mind system can be analyzed and predicted similar to the metaphor of ""finding the walking path in a cloudy or foggy day"". This is meant by stating ""The Nebulous Cartesian System"" (NCS). Descartes, at his time undertaking his genius step, did not possess the knowledge of today's physiology and modern physics; we think that the time has come to consider such a New Cartesian System. To deal with this, we propose the utilization of the Heisenberg S-Matrix and a modified version of the Feynman Diagrams which we call ""Brain Feynman Diagrams"". Another metaphor to consider within the oscillatory approach of the NCS is the ""string theory"". We also emphasize that fundamental steps should be undertaken in order to create the own dynamical framework of the brain-body-mind incorporation; suggestions or metaphors from physics and mathematics are useful; however, the grammar of the brains intrinsic language must be understood with the help of a new biologically founded, adaptive-probabilistic Cartesian system. This new Cartesian System will undergo mutations and transcend to the philosophy of Henri Bergson in parallel to the Evolution theory of Charles Darwin to open gateways for approaching the brain-body-mind problem. © 2006.",Alpha; Brain oscillations; Brain-body-mind; Chaos; Darwin; Evolution; Feynman Diagrams; Heisenberg S-Matrix; Quantum brain model; String theory,"article; autonomic nervous system; cardiovascular system; chaotic dynamics; conceptual framework; electroencephalogram; evolution; heart output; human; medical literature; nebulous cartesian system; nerve cell network; neuromodulation; neuroscience; oscillation; peristalsis; philosophy; smooth muscle; synaptic transmission; Brain; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Computer Simulation; Electroencephalography; Humans; Logic; Mind-Body Relations (Metaphysics); Models, Neurological; Neurosciences; Nonlinear Dynamics; Psychophysiology; Quantum Theory; Sympathetic Nervous System",2-s2.0-33947601633

Materials and Methods: Using a qualitative methodology, 44 edentulous patients who were receiving complete denture treatment were interviewed in private, in the Arabic language. Interviews were tape recorded and semistructured, following a list of predetermined and piloted topics, but dialogue also took place, with the freedom for both interviewer and interviewee to explore areas of interest. All recordings were transcribed, translated into English, and interpreted independently by two members of the team to identify the core themes associated with tooth loss. Results: The mean age of participants was 58.9 years (range 35 to 72 years), and they had been edentulous for a mean of 7.1 years (range 3 months to 22 years). The main themes related to tooth loss were unqualified acceptance, inevitability with old age, behavior changes with respect to eating comfort, aged appearance, self-responsibility, positively perceived benefits, high prosthetic expectations and reduced level of denture satisfaction, and some need for privacy. Conclusion: The lack of any outward indication that participants experienced bereavement suggests that outlook on life can influence the impact of tooth loss. Participants' unqualified acceptance of their edentulous fate, yet their clear need to ""normalize"" oral function, reflects a degree of pragmatism toward life events. The strong influence of religion in Saudi society is a possible factor in the sentiments expressed.",,"adult; aged; article; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; denture; female; human; interview; language; male; periodontal disease; qualitative analysis; tape recorder; tooth prosthesis; Adult; Aged; Aging; Attitude to Health; Denture, Complete; Eating; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Islam; Male; Middle Aged; Mouth, Edentulous; Patient Satisfaction; Privacy; Saudi Arabia; Self Assessment (Psychology); Self Concept; Tooth Loss",2-s2.0-0141924644

From this perspective the balance effect is the triple interaction, the positivity effect a main effect for the p-o factor, and the agreement effect a p-x by o-x interaction. Although the existence of the latter two effects has previously been regarded as damaging to balance theory, it was shown that these effects could be interpreted from a balance perspective and that balance theory could be used to generate supportable propositions regarding these effects. Thus in agreement with a unit-relation interpretation it was shown, in accordance with balance theory, that positivity effects are obtained when the subject, or p, assumes future contact with o, that reverse positivity effects are obtained when the subject anticipates breaking off contact with o, and that no positivity effect is obtained when there is absolutely no contact, past or future. It was also demonstrated in an experiment involving the p-o-q triad that, in accordance with balance theory, positivity effects may be produced by the assumption or inference of same-sign reciprocation in sentiment. Evidence for two balance processes underlying agreement effects was also found. One of these processes was based on the assumption that the subject would have or reveal psycho-logical reasons for the disagreement and thus produce imbalance. Consistent with this interpretation it was found that the agreement effect was significantly larger when future contact with discussion of x was assumed than when future contact without discussion of x was assumed. The other, or unit-relation interpretation was supported by evidence indicating that the breaking off of contact resulted in a reversed agreement effect. In general, it was argued that balance theory did quite well in such phenomenological investigations when attention was not narrowly restricted to the three-sign pattern but considered other potential cognitive bands. © 1974.",,,2-s2.0-49549151094

In this paper, we develop a novel healthcare recommendation system called iDoctor, which is based on hybrid matrix factorization methods. iDoctor differs from previous work in the following aspects: (1) emotional offset of user reviews can be unveiled by sentiment analysis and be utilized to revise original user ratings; (2) user preference and doctor feature are extracted by Latent Dirichlet Allocation and incorporated into conventional matrix factorization. We compare iDoctor with previous healthcare recommendation methods using real datasets. The experimental results show that iDoctor provides a higher predication rating and increases the accuracy of healthcare recommendation significantly. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Healthcare; Matrix factorization; Recommendation; Sentiment analysis; Topic model,Data mining; Decision support systems; Factorization; Health care; Statistics; Websites; Decision supports; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Matrix factorizations; Medical services; Recommendation; Recommendation methods; Sentiment analysis; Topic Modeling; Matrix algebra,2-s2.0-84955576796

These tasks, such as entity resolution, sentiment analysis, and image recognition can be enhanced through the use of human cognitive ability. Crowdsouring platforms are an effective way to harness the capabilities of people (i.e., the crowd) to apply human computation for such tasks. Thus, crowdsourced data management has become an area of increasing interest in research and industry. We identify three important problems in crowdsourced data management. (1) Quality Control: Workers may return noisy or incorrect results so effective techniques are required to achieve high quality; (2) Cost Control: The crowd is not free, and cost control aims to reduce the monetary cost; (3) Latency Control: The human workers can be slow, particularly compared to automated computing time scales, so latency-control techniques are required. There has been significant work addressing these three factors for designing crowdsourced tasks, developing crowdsourced data manipulation operators, and optimizing plans consisting of multiple operators. In this paper, we survey and synthesize a wide spectrum of existing studies on crowdsourced data management. Based on this analysis we then outline key factors that need to be considered to improve crowdsourced data management. © 1989-2012 IEEE.",cost control; Crowdsourcing; data management; human computation; latency control; quality control,Automation; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Crowdsourcing; Image recognition; Industrial research; Information management; Surveys; Cost controls; Data manipulations; Entity resolutions; Human cognitive abilities; Human computation; Latency control; Multiple operator; Sentiment analysis; Quality control,2-s2.0-84982126145

In this paper we investigate the relations between a well-known micro-blogging platform Twitter and financial markets. In particular, we consider, in a period of 15 months, the Twitter volume and sentiment about the 30 stock companies that form the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index.We find a relatively low Pearson correlation and Granger causality between the corresponding time series over the entire time period. However, we find a significant dependence between the Twitter sentiment and abnormal returns during the peaks of Twitter volume. This is valid not only for the expected Twitter volume peaks (e.g., quarterly announcements), but also for peaks corresponding to less obvious events. We formalize the procedure by adapting the well-known ""event study"" from economics and finance to the analysis of Twitter data. The procedure allows to automatically identify events as Twitter volume peaks, to compute the prevailing sentiment (positive or negative) expressed in tweets at these peaks, and finally to apply the ""event study"" methodology to relate them to stock returns. We show that sentiment polarity of Twitter peaks implies the direction of cumulative abnormal returns. The amount of cumulative abnormal returns is relatively low (about 1-2%), but the dependence is statistically significant for several days after the events. © 2015 Ranco et al.",,finance; Internet; market; time series analysis; blogging; commercial phenomena; financial management; human; Internet; social media; social support; Blogging; Commerce; Financial Management; Humans; Internet; Social Media; Social Support,2-s2.0-84946594788

Large datasets such as World Health Organization (WHO) statistics are collected less than once per year, whereas social network platforms, such as Twitter, offer the opportunity for real-time analysis of expressed mood. Such patterns are valuable to the mental health research community, to help understand the periods and locations of greatest demand and unmet need. We describe the ""We Feel"" system for analyzing global and regional variations in emotional expression, and report the results of validation against known patterns of variation in mood. 2.73 × 109 emotional tweets were collected over a 12-week period, and automatically annotated for emotion, geographic location, and gender. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the data illustrated a dominant in-phase pattern across all emotions, modulated by antiphase patterns for ""positive"" and ""negative"" emotions. The first three principal components accounted for over 90% of the variation in the data. PCA was also used to remove the dominant diurnal and weekly variations allowing identification of significant events within the data, with z-scores showing expression of emotions over 80 standard deviations from the mean. We also correlate emotional expression with WHO data at a national level and although no correlations were observed for the burden of depression, the burden of anxiety and suicide rates appeared to correlate with expression of particular emotions. © 2013 IEEE.",mental health; sentiment analysis; Twitter,Health; Social networking (online); Emotional expressions; Geographic location; Mental health; Principal Components; Sentiment analysis; Standard deviation; Twitter; World Health Organization; Principal component analysis; classification; emotion; female; human; male; medical informatics; mental health; social media; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Medical Informatics Computing; Mental Health; Social Media,2-s2.0-84938385253

Given a set of reviews, the main task of aspect-based opinion mining is to extract major aspects of the items and to infer the latent aspect ratings from each review. However, users may have different preferences which might lead to different opinions on the same aspect of an item. Even if fine-grained aspect rating analysis is provided for each review, it is still difficult for a user to judge whether a specific aspect of an item meets his own expectation. In this paper, we study the problem of estimating personalized sentiment polarities on different aspects of the items. We propose a unified probabilistic model called Factorized Latent Aspect ModEl (FLAME), which combines the advantages of collaborative filtering and aspect based opinion mining. FLAME learns users' personalized preferences on different aspects from their past reviews, and predicts users' aspect ratings on new items by collective intelligence. Experiments on two online review datasets show that FLAME outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the tasks of aspect identification and aspect rating prediction.

The basic idea is to use more than one composition functions and adaptively select them depending on the input vectors. We present a general framework to model each semantic composition as a distribution over these composition functions. The composition functions and parameters used for adaptive selection are learned jointly from data. We integrate AdaMC into existing recursive neural models and conduct extensive experiments on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank.

This study examines how two firm-controllable marketing factors, advertising and marketing capability, moderate the relationship between news stories and firm stock returns. Analysis of a panel data set of more than 7,000 firm-month observations indicates asymmetric and complementary moderating roles of the two marketing variables: advertising reinforces the favorable impact of positive news on abnormal stock returns, and marketing capability mitigates the adverse impact of negative news. Moreover, these moderating effects operate through different stakeholders. Whereas the moderating effect of marketing capability is due to its influence on customers and thus affects the level and volatility of future cash flows, advertising moderates the effect of news through individual investors' attention and response to the news. The econometric analysis accounts for potential endogeneity between news reports, stock returns, and marketing variables, and the results are robust to alternative measures and analysis approaches. The findings suggest the need for managers to broaden their stakeholder focus when evaluating advertising's returns and to communicate the value of marketing capability to investors. © 2013.

Based on this review, we show that a common limitation of most of these datasets, when assessing sentiment analysis at target (entity) level, is the lack of distinctive sentiment annotations among the tweets and the entities contained in them. For example, the tweet ""I love iPhone, but I hate iPad"" can be annotated with a mixed sentiment label, but the entity iPhone within this tweet should be annotated with a positive sentiment label. Aiming to overcome this limitation, and to complement current evaluation datasets, we present STS-Gold, a new evaluation dataset where tweets and targets (entities) are annotated individually and therefore may present different sentiment labels.

In this work we employed a large query log sample from a commercial web search engine to identify the struggles and search behavior of children of the age of 6 to young adults of the age of 18. Concretely we hypothesized that the large and complex volume of information to which children are exposed leads to ill-defined searches and to disorientation during the search process. For this purpose, we quantified their search difficulties based on query metrics (e.g. fraction of queries posed in natural language), session metrics (e.g. fraction of abandoned sessions) and click activity (e.g. fraction of ad clicks). We also used the search logs to retrace stages of child development. Concretely we looked for changes in the user interests (e.g. distribution of topics searched), language development (e.g. readability of the content accessed) and cognitive development (e.g. sentiment expressed in the queries) among children and adults. We observed that these metrics clearly demonstrate an increased level of confusion and unsuccessful search sessions among children. We also found a clear relation between the reading level of the clicked pages and the demographics characteristics of the users such as age and average educational attainment of the zone in which the user is located. © 2011 ACM.",children; query logs; session analysis; topic classification; web search,children; Query logs; session analysis; Topic Classification; Web searches; Classification (of information); Education; Information retrieval; Knowledge management; Search engines; World Wide Web,2-s2.0-83055187690

One prominent argument is that greater economic inequality prompts states to generate more nationalism as a diversion that discourages their citizens from recognizing economic inequality and mobilizing against it. Several other theories, however, propose different relationships between economic inequality and nationalism. This article provides a first empirical test of whether and how economic inequality is related to nationalism. Multilevel analyses using survey data on nationalist sentiments in countries around the world over a quarter century and data on economic inequality from the Standardized World Income Inequality Database provide powerful support for the diversionary theory of nationalism. This finding is an important contribution to our understanding of nationalism as well as of the political consequences of economic inequality. © 2011 Southern Political Science Association.",,,2-s2.0-82455168182

Drawing on historical climatology, environmental history, and Cuban and American colonial history, Sherry Johnson innovatively integrates the region's experience with extreme weather events and patterns into the history of the Spanish Caribbean and the Atlantic world. By superimposing this history of natural disasters over the conventional timeline of sociopolitical and economic events in Caribbean colonial history, Johnson presents an alternative analysis in which some of the signal events of the Age of Revolution are seen as consequences of ecological crisis and of the resulting measures for disaster relief. For example, Johnson finds that the general adoption in 1778 of free trade in the Americas was catalyzed by recognition of the harsh realities of food scarcity and the needs of local colonists reeling from a series of natural disasters. Weather-induced environmental crises and slow responses from imperial authorities, Johnson argues, played an inextricable and, until now, largely unacknowledged role in the rise of revolutionary sentiments in the eighteenth-century. © 2011 The University of North Carolina Press.

Reasons for the conflict are contested and complicated by social, religious, political, and cultural disputes, with much of the debate concerning the victims of violence hardened by competing propaganda-conditioning perspectives. This article introduces a database holding information on the location of individual fatalities connected with the contemporary Irish conflict. For each victim, it includes a demographic profile, home address, manner of death, and the organization responsible. Employing geographic information system (GIS) techniques, the database is used to measure, map, and analyze the spatial distribution of conflict-related deaths between 1966 and 2007 across Belfast, the capital city of Northern Ireland, with respect to levels of segregation, social and economic deprivation, and interfacing. The GIS analysis includes a kernel density estimator designed to generate smooth intensity surfaces of the conflict-related deaths by both incident and home locations. Neighborhoods with high-intensity surfaces of deaths were those with the highest levels of segregation (>90 percent Catholic or Protestant) and deprivation, and they were located near physical barriers, the so-called peacelines, between predominantly Catholic and predominantly Protestant communities. Finally, despite the onset of peace and the formation of a power-sharing and devolved administration (the Northern Ireland Assembly), disagreements remain over the responsibility and ""commemoration"" of victims, sentiments that still uphold division and atavistic attitudes between spatially divided Catholic and Protestant populations. © 2009 by Association of American Geographers.",Belfast; Conflict; Deaths; Northern Ireland; Paramilitary; Segregation,conflict management; cultural conflict; cultural influence; database; demographic survey; ethnic conflict; GIS; mortality; neighborhood; peace process; political violence; spatial distribution; state-local relations; Belfast [Belfast (DST)]; Belfast [Northern Ireland]; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Ireland; United Kingdom; Western Europe,2-s2.0-70450183064

In particular, one important form of insights can be derived from sentiment analysis on web content. Sentiment analysis traditionally emphasizes on classification of web comments into positive, neutral, and negative categories. This paper goes beyond sentiment classification by focusing on techniques that could detect the topics that are highly correlated with the positive and negative opinions. Such techniques, when coupled with sentiment classification, can help the business analysts to understand both the overall sentiment scope as well as the drivers behind the sentiment. In this paper, we describe our overall sentiment analysis system that consists of such sentiment analysis techniques.

It deserves a large readership, both within and beyond academe."" -Ralph Levering, Vail Professor of History, Davidson College In terms of military and economic power, the United States remains one of the strongest nations in the world. Yet the United States seems to have lost the power of persuasion, the ability to make allies and win international support. Why? Immediately after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, leaders and citizens of foreign nations generally expressed sympathy for the United States. Since then, attitudes have changed. Drawing upon public opinion surveys conducted in 30 nations, Ole R. Holsti documents an increasing anti-American sentiment. His analysis suggests that the war in Iraq, human rights violations, and unpopular international policies are largely responsible. Consequently, the United States can rebuild its repute by adopting an unselfish, farsighted approach to global issues. Indeed, the United States must restore goodwill abroad, Holsti asserts, because public opinion indirectly influences the leaders who decide whether or not to side with the Americans.

In the meantime, a growing number of studies have adopted conversation analysis (CA), the sociological methodology on which Firth and Wagner have built their arguments, to examine data involving second language speakers, even though not all these studies may be viewed as addressing the issue of language learning and therefore may not belong to the category of SLA studies.

However, many other criteria for clustering documents can be considered: for example, documents' genre or the author's mood. We propose an interactive scheme for clustering document collections, based on any criterion of the user's preference. The user holds an active position in the clustering process: first, she chooses the types of features suitable to the underlying task, leading to a task-specific document representation. She can then provide examples of features - if such examples are emerging, e.g., when clustering by the author's sentiment, words like 'perfect', 'mediocre', 'awful' are intuitively good features. The algorithm proceeds iteratively, and the user can fix errors made by the clustering system at the end of each iteration. Such an interactive clustering method demonstrates excellent results on clustering by sentiment, substantially outperforming an SVM trained on a large amount of labeled data. Even if features are not provided because they are not intuitively obvious to the user - e.g., what would be good features for clustering by genre using part-of-speech trigrams? - our multi-modal clustering method performs significantly better than k -means and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).",,Clustering documents; Clustering methods; Clustering process; Clustering system; Document Clustering; Document Representation; Latent dirichlet allocations; User's preferences; Artificial intelligence; Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Statistics; Iterative methods,2-s2.0-84880904276

More specifically, I analyse possible links between aspects of national identity and fear of foreigners - or xenophobia - in Norway and Sweden. Such ideas involve hypotheses at different levels and imply a step-by-step approach, analytically and empirically. It is argued that the concept of national identity could be specified within at least two dimensions: national chauvinism and system legitimacy, and it is further hypothesized that these factors affect xenophobia in a nuanced manner. The empirical analyses build and test a proper measurement model for the three concepts (chauvinism, legitimacy and xenophobia), later developed into a complex causal model. These analyses rely on recent advances in structural equation modelling (SEM) for the treatment of ordinal data and the handling of different covariance as well as mean structures. Data for Norway and Sweden come from the new national identity module collected in 1995 by ISSP. Results from various LISREL analyses support the crucial notion of a common measurement model for the two samples, making comparisons within and between countries more meaningful than otherwise. Findings demonstrate similar attitude structures for Norwegians and Swedes. Furthermore, the extended causal analysis shows that chauvinism and legitimacy clearly affect xenophobia on the individual level, partly also explaining national differences. However, even when differences of such sentiments are taken into account Norwegians still stand out as the more xenophobic, thus pointing toward the need for supplementary interpretations.",,,2-s2.0-0040563167

The circumstances of Tamil dissatisfaction with Sinhalese society and the state apparatus provided an ideal scenario for the crystallisation of this emphasis. The LTTE have seized the opportunity and built up a cult of martyrdom as a mobilisational device, cementing force and precise weapon. Such instrumental usages should not obscure the likelihood that, among the Tiger leadership, the cyanide vial is both instrument and faith. Speculatively it is suggested that the varied expressions of Tamil sentiment in northern Sri Lanka during the 1960s and 1970s-before the Tigers secured their dominance—will reveal an emphasis on filial devotion in ways which draw on Caizkam and bhakti traditions. The article therefore draws attention to certain continuities in the popular folk cults in Tamil lands—traditions which provide a seedbed of evocative symbols that, in specific contexts, can impel, or be made to impel, individuals in sacrificial directions. The essqy argues that the understanding of such subjectivities and these essentialising moves among the Tamil militants requires a measure of essentialisation in our approaches. It elaborates this view through a critical review of Pandian's instrumental and semiotic analysis of the MGR phenomenon, a review which enables the author to introduce the hermeneutic approach of the early Taussig and his own subjectivist emphasis on the manner in which some Tamils merge their being with that of the icon of their hearts, be it MGR, Eelam or Prabhakaran. © 1996, Sage Publications.

This is especially a problem for the tweets sentiment analysis. Since the topics in Twitter are very diverse, it is impossible to train a universal classifier for all topics. Moreover, compared to product review, Twitter lacks data labeling and a rating mechanism to acquire sentiment labels. The extremely sparse text of tweets also brings down the performance of a sentiment classifier. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised topic-adaptive sentiment classification (TASC) model, which starts with a classifier built on common features and mixed labeled data from various topics. It minimizes the hinge loss to adapt to unlabeled data and features including topic-related sentiment words, authors' sentiments and sentiment connections derived from '@' mentions of tweets, named as topic-adaptive features. Text and non-text features are extracted and naturally split into two views for co-training. The TASC learning algorithm updates topic-adaptive features based on the collaborative selection of unlabeled data, which in turn helps to select more reliable tweets to boost the performance. We also design the adapting model along a timeline (TASC-t) for dynamic tweets. An experiment on 6 topics from published tweet corpuses demonstrates that TASC outperforms other well-known supervised and ensemble classifiers. It also beats those semi-supervised learning methods without feature adaption. Meanwhile, TASC-t can also achieve impressive accuracy and F-score. Finally, with timeline visualization of 'river' graph, people can intuitively grasp the ups and downs of sentiments' evolvement, and the intensity by color gradation. © 1989-2012 IEEE.",adaptive feature; cross-domain; multiclass SVM; sentiment classification; topic-adaptive; Twitter,Learning algorithms; Social networking (online); Supervised learning; Text processing; Adaptive features; Cross-domain; Multiclass SVM; Sentiment classification; topic-adaptive; Twitter; Classification (of information),2-s2.0-84929498030

In this paper, we explore the use of fuzzy logic for modeling concept polarities, and the uncertainty associated with them, with respect to different domains. The approach is based on the use of a knowledge graph built by combining two linguistic resources, namely WordNet and SenticNet. Such a knowledge graph is then exploited by a graph-propagation algorithm that propagates sentiment information learned from labeled datasets.

Supervised learning classifiers often misclassify tweets containing conjunctions such as “but” and conditionals such as “if”, due to their special linguistic characteristics. These classifiers also assign a decision score very close to the decision boundary for a large number tweets, which suggests that they are simply unsure instead of being completely wrong about these tweets. To counter these two challenges, this paper proposes a system that enhances supervised learning for polarity classification by leveraging on linguistic rules and sentic computing resources.

The public is biopolitically moderate, endorses both meritocratic principles and the intrinsic value of hard work, and appears to be sensitive to the salient moral issues raised in the debate.

Identifying features associated with opinions expressed in reviews is essential for fine-grained opinion mining. One approach is to exploit the dependency relations that occur naturally between features and opinion words, and among features (or opinion words) themselves. In this paper, we propose a generalized approach to opinion feature extraction by incorporating robust statistical association analysis in a bootstrapping framework. The new approach starts with a small set of feature seeds, on which it iteratively enlarges by mining feature-opinion, feature-feature, and opinion-opinion dependency relations. Two association model types, namely likelihood ratio tests (LRT) and latent semantic analysis (LSA), are proposed for computing the pair-wise associations between terms (features or opinions). We accordingly propose two robust bootstrapping approaches, LRTBOOT and LSABOOT, both of which need just a handful of initial feature seeds to bootstrap opinion feature extraction. We benchmarked LRTBOOT and LSABOOT against existing approaches on a large number of real-life reviews crawled from the cellphone and hotel domains. Experimental results using varying number of feature seeds show that the proposed association-based bootstrapping approach significantly outperforms the competitors. In fact, one seed feature is all that is needed for LRTBOOT to significantly outperform the other methods. This seed feature can simply be the domain feature, e.g., ""cellphone"" or ""hotel"". The consequence of our discovery is far reaching: starting with just one feature seed, typically just the domain concept word, LRTBOOT can automatically extract a large set of high-quality opinion features from the corpus without any supervision or labeled features. This means that the automatic creation of a set of domain features is no longer a pipe dream! © 2012 ACM.",aspect; association; bootstrapping; feature; opinion mining; seed; sentiment analysis,aspect; bootstrapping; feature; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Association reactions; Feature extraction; Iterative methods; Knowledge management; Seed; Semantics; Telephone sets; Data mining,2-s2.0-84871049330

In predicting the topic of a document, we might know that two words are synonyms, and when performing image recognition, we know which pixels are adjacent. Such synonymous or neighboring features are near-duplicates and should be expected to have similar weights in an accurate model. Here we present a framework for regularized learning when one has prior knowledge about which features are expected to have similar and dissimilar weights. The prior knowledge is encoded as a network whose vertices are features and whose edges represent similarities and dissimilarities between them.

Inconsistent with regime-shifting beliefs, we find that subjects are not more likely to predict that the current streak will continue the longer the streak. Instead, consistent with Rabin (2002), subjects are more likely to expect a reversal following short streaks and continuation after long streaks. Results of a ""test-of-fit"" analysis based on structural estimation of each model also favor the model in Rabin. To provide more insight on Rabin, we use an additional experimental treatment to show that as the perception of the randomness of the outcome-generating process increases, subjects are more likely to predict reversals of current streaks. © 2009 INFORMS.",Behavioral finance; Decision analysis; Experimental economics; Inference,Behavioral finance; Decision analysis; Experimental economics; Experimental evidence; Laboratory experiments; Law-of-small numbers; Probability assessments; Random sequence; Structural estimation; Binary sequences; Decision making; Decision theory; Random errors; Economics,2-s2.0-73249115513

In this article, I attempt to review the account of spatial and political responsibilities elaborated through such writing, arguing that its focus upon spatial connections and flows develops those concerns with partialist and impartialist sentiments noted in literature on geography's 'moral turn'. The article reviews the development of the work of Doreen Massey in particular to consider how a relational politics of space has come to represent a call for a concern for both the relations which run 'into' and 'out from' place. By examining a number of examples of this form of a 'politics beyond place', I argue that viewing space relationally offers a versatile account of the diverse claims made by a series of spatial issues, such as climate change and fair-trade relations. The article concludes by suggesting how a relational politics might present an alternative geographical imagination of extensive political responsibilities. © 2009 The Author Journal Compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,climate change; ethics; political relations; spatial analysis; trade relations,2-s2.0-71949130507

We measure the relative optimism of presidential remarks on the economy through content analysis of all public statements on the general economy and unemployment from January 1978 through April 2002. Controlling for current and past economic performance, we use vector autoregression analysis to show that presidential remarks significantly affect people's perceptions of the economic news, as well as their confidence about current and future economic conditions. Using simulation analyses, we also demonstrate that presidential rhetoric operating through these indirect channels can have substantial impacts on U.S. economic growth and unemployment.

Because the war was part of systemic change in the nation, including the adoption of more democratic and capitalist social formation, we also anticipated economic and political liberalism to be present among a sizeable portion of the population. We provide an analysis of the structural conditions fostering these sentiments, an analysis potentially applicable to a range of societies presently in transition. Based on 1996 survey interviews (N = 2,202) conducted throughout Croatia, we show that ethnic nationalism in the Croatian context is more widely shared than is liberalism. The effect of religious fundamentalism, educational attainment and media exposure are as predicted, based on theories of liberalism and nationalism. Wartime experiences and position in the occupational system have a weaker and more mixed influence than hypothesised. Perhaps most importantly, we find that three out of five Croatians embrace both ethnic-national views and views that are distinctly liberal, suggesting that liberal nationalism is now dominant in Croatia. The characteristics of groups holding differing views suggest that recent events and current changes in Croatia bode positively for continued growth of liberal sentiments, but this will not necessarily be at the expense of ethnic nationalism.",,ethnicity; liberalism; nationalism; post-war; Croatia,2-s2.0-0037252677

This research argues that the outsized investment into co-op infrastructure is explicable when the cultural and political economy of cooperation is analyzed. It is found that (1) well-defined co-op spaces are necessary if co-op members are to meet market-driven quality standards, yet these autonomous production spaces exclude non-member villagers upon whom the co-op depends. Given this sentiment, (2) the co-op building plays an important political role in persuading villagers to provide social support and access to communal resources by (3) demonstrating that production cooperation presents a reasonable development alternative and that co-op members have the managerial capacity to achieve it.

It is also related to Wittgenstein's notion of 'forms of life' as a new focus of empirical research. In the first part of this article we distinguish between and explain Wittgenstein's initial understanding of language as the symbolic representation of sensory experience and his eventual under-standing of the dialectic of language-games and forms of life. In the second part, the cue of his linking of language to experiential forms of life, even to what can be called the 'body-subject' in Merleau-Ponty's terminology, will be taken up and further improvised in order to show the challenge with which Wittgenstein's legacy confronts present-day psychology. In this science one has to come to grips with meaning-giving (and taking, for that matter) as an experiential affair. This task requires an analysis of people's culturally informed body, their bodily structured sentiments and the use of language confined to these bodily and affective structures, and of the way these structures are framed by people's forms of life, in order to fully understand what presses people to experience the world in this and not the other way. © 1995, Sage Publications.

While it shares a number of continuities with other cities, it reveals several structural and cultural features which are absent or significantly at variance with patterns elsewhere. These include extreme residential segregation, a powerful white local sentiment and insular identity, and extremely virulent 'racialised' hostility. In addition, the black population is markedly different in its length of residence, its ethnic and national origins, the proportion of mixed parentage and the frequency of mixed dating and marriages. All of this has occurred in the context of regional deprivation scanning four decades. Consequently, theoretical, policy and empirical generalisations about 'racialised relations' in England apply to Liverpool only with unacceptable modifications. This analysis makes a contribution to the 'racialisation' problematic, elaborates the intricate interplay of 'racisms' and class relations and relates the interaction between local and broader contexts. It is argued that any attempt to create change in Liverpool must take account of the particular manifestations of 'racialised' hostility found there, in the context of underlying continuities nationally. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Using improved data on prices, this paper provides a mixture of classical and Bayesian estimates of beverage-specific demand functions. The analysis is carried out at the state level for the year 1982. Independent variables include the real own-price, substitute prices, income, tourism activity, religious sentiment, youth proxy, and several regulatory measures including monopoly control, bans on price advertising, minimum legal drinking age, and restrictions on the number and type of retail outlets. The results indicate no direct effect of monopoly control on consumption that is separate from effects manifested by higher prices or, for beer, limited outlets. Furthermore, average prices are not significantly greater in the monopoly states. Several possible explanations are advanced to explain these results, including the likelihood that the higher transaction costs in the monopoly states are a tax on consumption of alcohol. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,2-s2.0-0040013532

Explanations of this lack of behavioral response that emphasize public apathy fail to account for prior instances of widespread public involvement in the area of arms control (e.g., the successful protest over atmospheric testing and the massive nuclear freeze rallies in 1982). Thus, the analysis of arms control inactivity must extend beyond general critiques of public apathy toward an understanding of factors that promote or inhibit behavioral opposition. The current article outlines a set of psychological factors that may serve to interrupt the connection between strong conviction against nuclear arms policies and subsequent political action. These proposed factors are used to evaluate the psychological utility of existing and potential strategies for promoting arms control activism. Subsequently, the implications of this conceptual framework for psychology's understanding and promotion of arms control activism are discussed.",,,2-s2.0-0000577566

In recent years the spectre of global warming and ocean acidification, which has been primarily attributed to fossil fuel burning, has brought renewable energy at the forefront of most climate change mitigation strategies. There is strong advocacy for large-scale substitution of conventional energy sources with the renewables on the premise that such a move would substantially reduce environmental degradation and global warming. These sentiments are being echoed by scientists and policy makers as well as environmental activists all over the world.'Small hydro', which generally represents hydroelectric power projects of capacities 25. MW or lower, is one of the renewable energy options which is believed to be clean and sustainable even as its bigger version, large hydro, is known to cause several strongly adverse environmental impacts. This paper brings out that the prevailing perception of 'eco-friendliness' of small hydro is mainly due to the fact that it has only been used to a very small extent so far. But once it is deployed at a scale comparable to fossil fuel use, the resulting impacts would be quite substantially adverse. The purpose is not to denegrade small hydro, less so to advocate use of fossil fuels. It, rather, is to bring home the point that a much more realistic and elaborate assessment of the likely direct as well as indirect impacts of extensive utilization of this energy source than has been done hitherto is necessary. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Environmental impacts; Global warming; Large hydro; Methane mining; Renewable energy; Small hydro,Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Hydroelectric power; Methane; Adverse environmental impacts; Climate change mitigation; Conventional energy sources; Hydroelectric installations; Hydroelectric power projects; Large hydro; Renewable energies; Small hydro; Renewable energy resources; methane; alternative energy; energy resource; environmental impact; global warming; hydroelectric power; hydroelectric power plant; installation; renewable resource; article; climate change; eco-friendliness; energy conservation; energy resource; energy yield; environmental impact assessment; environmental parameters; environmental protection; environmental stress; greenhouse effect; habitat quality; hydropower; large hydropower project; life cycle assessment; nonhuman; priority journal; risk benefit analysis; small hydropower project; social problem; surface water hydrology; water flow; Environmental impacts; Global warming; Large hydro; Methane mining; Renewable energy; Small hydro; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Energy-Generating Resources; Environment; Global Warming; Power Plants; Water Resources,2-s2.0-84897958873

Yet, the ever-growing amount of data in different languages on the Web renders multi-lingual support increasingly important. In this paper, we assess various methods for supporting an additional target language in lexicon-based sentiment analysis. As a baseline, we automatically translate text into a reference language for which a sentiment lexicon is available, and subsequently analyze the translated text. Second, we consider mapping sentiment scores from a semantically enabled sentiment lexicon in the reference language to a new target sentiment lexicon, by traversing relations between language-specific semantic lexicons. Last, we consider creating a target sentiment lexicon by propagating sentiment of seed words in a semantic lexicon for the target language. When extending sentiment analysis from English to Dutch, mapping sentiment across languages by exploiting relations between semantic lexicons yields a significant performance improvement over the baseline of about 29% in terms of accuracy and macro-level F1 on our data.

Understanding the interplay of users' sentiments and social relationships can be potentially valuable. Specifically, we study how to exploit sentiment homophily for link prediction. We evaluate our approach on a dataset gathered from Twitter that consists of tweets sent in one month during U.S. 2012 political campaign along with the ""follows "" relationship between users. Our first con- tribution is defining a set of sentiment-based features that help predict the likelihood of two users becoming ""friends "" (i.e., mutually mentioning or following each other) based on their sentiments toward topics of mutual interest. Our eval- uation in a supervised learning framework demonstrates the benefits of sentiment-based features in link prediction. We find that Adamic-Adar and Euclidean distance measures are the best predictors. Our second contribution is proposing a factor graph model that incorporates a sentiment-based variant of cognitive balance theory. Our evaluation shows that, when tie strength is not too weak, our model is more effective in link prediction than traditional machine learning techniques.

In this paper, we study the dynamics of news events and their relation to changes of sentiment expressed on relevant topics. We propose a novel framework, which models the behavior of news and social media in response to events as a convolution between event's importance and media response function, specific to media and event type. This framework is suitable for detecting time and duration of events, as well as their impact and dynamics, from time series of publication volume. These data can greatly enhance events analysis; for instance, they can help distinguish important events from unimportant, or predict sentiment and stock market shifts. As an example of such application, we extracted news events for a variety of topics and then correlated this data with the corresponding sentiment time series, revealing the connection between sentiment shifts and event dynamics. © 2014 ACM.",information spread; news dynamics; sentiment analysis; social media,,2-s2.0-84907033518

Aim: To analyze scientific and social bases for concerns regarding T therapy. Methods: Analysis of recent articles regarding CV risks with T and comparison with events surrounding publication of results of the Women's Health Initiative in 2002. Results: In the first study, the percentage of individuals with an adverse event was lower by half in men who received T compared with untreated men (10.1% vs. 21.2%). However, an opposite conclusion was reached via complex statistics. The second study reported minor increased rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) up to 90 days after receiving a T prescription compared with the prior 12 months. However, there was no control group, so it is unknown whether this MI rate was increased, reduced, or unchanged compared with untreated men. Neither study provided substantive evidence of risk, yet these were lauded as proof of dangers, despite a substantial literature to the contrary. Similar events followed the publication of the Women's Health Initiative in 2002 when a media frenzy over increased risks with female hormone replacement therapy obscured the fact that the reported excess risk was clinically meaningless, at two events per 1,000person-years. Stakeholders driving concerns regarding hormone risks are unlikely to be clinicians with real-world patient experience. Conclusions: The use of weak studies as proof of danger indicates that cultural (i.e., nonscientific) forces are at play. Negative media stories touting T's risks appear fueled by antipharma sentiment, anger against aggressive marketing, and antisexuality. This stance is best described as ""hormonophobia."" As history shows, evidence alone may be insufficient to alter a public narrative.

However, this assumption is oversimplified. In this study, we employ an innovative 'context-rich heterogeneous network' approach, which paves a new way for citation recommendation task. In the network, we characterize 1) the importance of citation relationships between citing and cited papers, and 2) the topical citation motivation. Unlike earlier studies, the citation information, in this paper, is characterized by citation textual contexts extracted from the full-text citing paper.

Integrating these two sources of data not only enriches the information available for the forecasting model, but it can potentially capture joint patterns that may not otherwise be identified when each data source is employed separately. We start with market data and then gradually add various textual data representations, going from simple representations, such as word counts, to more advanced representations involving sentiment analysis. To find the incremental value of each data representation, we build an end-to-end recommendation process including data preprocessing, modeling, validation, trade recommendations and economic evaluation. Each component of the modeling process is optimized to remove human bias and to allow us to impartially compare the results of the various models. Additionally, we experiment with several forecasting algorithms to find the one that yields the ""best"" results according to a variety of performance criteria. We employ data representation procedures and modeling improvements beyond those used in previous related studies. The economic evaluation of the results is conducted using a simulation procedure that inherently accounts for transaction costs and eliminates biases that have potentially affected previous related data-mining studies. This research is one of the largest-scale data-mining studies for evaluating the effectiveness of integrating market data with textual news data for the purpose of stock investment recommendations. The results of our study are promising in that they show that augmenting market data with advanced textual data representation significantly improves stock purchase decisions.

Users constantly post snippets of information regarding their actions, interests or perception of their surroundings, which is why they have been attributed the term Live Web. Nevertheless, research on such platforms has been quite limited when it comes to identifying events, but is rapidly gaining ground. Event identification is a key step to news reporting, proactive or reactive crisis management at multiple scales, efficient resource allocation, etc. In this paper, we focus on the problem of automatically identifying events as they occur, in such a user-driven, fast paced and voluminous setting. We propose a novel and natural way to address the issue using notions from emotional theories, combined with spatiotemporal information and employ online event detection mechanisms to solve it at large scale in a distributed fashion. We present a modular framework that incorporates all of our key ideas and experimentally validate its superiority, in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness, over the state-of-the-art using real life data from the Twitter stream.

Most current work focuses on either developing aggregated measures or opinion extraction methods like sentiment analysis. These approaches suffer from unpredictable turnover in the participants and the information they react to, making it difficult to distinguish meaningful shifts from those that follow from known information. We propose a novel approach to tame these sources of uncertainty through the introduction of ""computational focus groups"" to track opinion shifts in social media streams. Our approach uses prior user behaviors to detect users' biases, then groups users with similar biases together. We track the behavior streams from these like-minded subgroups and present time-dependent collective measures of their opinions. These measures control for the response rate and base attitudes of the users, making shifts in opinion both easier to detect and easier to interpret. We test the effectiveness of our system by tracking groups' Twitter responses to a common stimulus set: the 2012 U.S. presidential election debates. While our groups' behavior is consistent with their biases, there are numerous moments and topics on which they behave ""out of character,"" suggesting precise targets for follow-up inquiry. We also demonstrate that tracking elite users with well-established biases does not yield such insights, as they are insensitive to the stimulus and simply reproduce expected patterns. The efffectiveness of our system suggests a new direction both for researchers and data-driven journalists interested in identifying opinion shifting processes in real-time.

We apply sentiment analysis techniques to classify the position (for, against, neutral) expressed in a tweet about a controversial topic and use the results in our study of user behavior. Our findings suggest that Twitter is primarily used for spreading information to like-minded people rather than debating issues.

Grounded in an analysis of how neoliberal welfare-state reform in Lombardy, northern Italy, is rendered through core idioms of the Catholic imaginative universe, I argue that the Lombardian case offers general insight into the ""moral style"" of contemporary neoliberalism. In contrast to the messianic gospel of prosperity exhibited by the Protestant ethic at the turn of the millennium (a gospel that promised instantaneous rushes of wealth through quasi-magical means), the charisma of Catholicized neoliberalism lies not in its rejection of the market but in its injunction that parts of this wealth ought to be redistributed through charitable actions. Catholicized neoliberalism thus hinges on a loving empathetic subject that purportedly repairs the damages of excessive marketization. It couples market rule to moral sentiment, economic rationality to the emotional urgencies of caritas. Although this new culture of feeling and action tends to leave neoliberalism's basic structural features intact, it also at times allows for the disruption of market rule. © 2013 by the American Anthropological Association.",Catholicism; Love; Moral style; Neoliberalism; Voluntarism,,2-s2.0-84882704971

We first identify and describe the role of innovation and creativity in economic and social development policies over the past 20 years, then analyze how the call for enhanced Chinese innovation and creativity was actualized in corresponding education policies. The article concludes with an analysis of issues surrounding Chinese education policy toward creativity and several directions for future research in this area. Many visitors to mainland China have observed that it is a land of contradictions, and this certainly holds true for the Chinese view of their own creativity. On one hand, people around the world can recite thousands of years of Chinese inventiveness, ranging from gunpowder to noodles, from the civil service to intellectual examinations, among many other innovations. On the other hand, sentiments such as ""Chinese students lack creativity"" and ""Chinese people need to be more creative"" are common topics in Chinese media and academic journals, reflecting a conventional wisdom that China is no longer a creative country. Over the past two decades, researchers have conducted a number of studies on these issues and have provided some reasonable explanations for the apparent lack of perceived creativity among Chinese students and adults (e.g., Chan & Chan, 1999; Niu & Sternberg, 2003; Wu, 2004). Niu and Sternberg (2003) believed that Chinese social values, school pedagogic practices, and educational testing systems were responsible for the comparative lack of creativity among Chinese students. They claimed that overemphasizing conformity, analytic thinking, and test scores significantly decrease Chinese students' creative performance. Chan and Chan (1999), in an investigation of Chinese teachers' perceptions of creative students, found that the teachers often regarded characteristics of creative students as socially undesirable. Prior research also revealed that while Chinese teachers value the significance of creativity, they know less about how to teach creativity (Chien & Hui, 2010). In recent years, researchers have begun to explore Chinese creativity education from a policy perspective. For instance, based on the analysis of China's educational documents issued in 1998, Hui and Lau (2010) found that, in mainland China, innovation was usually regarded as synonymous with creativity, but that creativity education was not sufficiently emphasized in the larger community. Nonetheless, it seems the prior research on China's ""creativity problem"" has not captured the whole picture of Chinese creativity education. On the one hand, China's creativity education is tightly associated with national developmental strategies. Under China's top-down approach to policymaking, national strategies can dramatically affect national and local educational policies, which in turn determine the practices of teaching creativity. Therefore, it will be very difficult to grasp the essentials of China's creativity education unless considered in the context of national strategies. On the other hand, since the beginning of the new century, particularly in the past 5 years, many significant changes have occurred in China's national strategies for promoting innovation and creativity. This has brought about new transformations in China's educational policies on creativity education, indicating the potential for great change in the corresponding educational practices for developing Chinese students' creativity. As such, the purpose of this study is to examine the recent transformations of China's educational policies for fostering innovation and creativity. The article is divided into two main parts. The first part concerns the changes in the national strategies for innovation and creativity so as to provide a context for analyzing the transformations in educational policies. The second part focuses on the specific changes in creativity education policies, with a particular focus on recent policy developments in this area. The study concludes with a discussion of potential problems with the current education policies. Copyright © 2013 by the Creative Education Foundation, Inc.",,,2-s2.0-84873634467

Identifying the semantic orientation of subjective terms (words or phrases) is a fundamental task for sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose a new method for identifying the semantic orientation of subjective terms to perform sentiment analysis. The method takes a classification approach that is based on a novel semantic orientation representation model called S-HAL (Sentiment Hyperspace Analogue to Language). S-HAL basically produces a set of weighted features based on surrounding words, and characterizes the semantic orientation information of words via a specific feature space. Because the method incorporates the idea underlying HAL and the hypothesis verified by the method of semantic orientation inference from pointwise mutual information (SO-PMI), it can quickly and accurately identify the semantic orientation of terms without the use of an Internet search engine. The results of an empirical evaluation show that our method outperforms other known methods. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Twitter, a micro-blogging service, is estimated to have about 200 million registered users and these users create approximately 65 million tweets a day. Twitter users usually show their opinion about topics of their interest. The challenge is that each tweet is limited in 140 characters, and is hence very short. It may contain slang and misspelled words. Thus, it is difficult to apply traditional NLP techniques which are designed for working with formal languages, into Twitter domain. Another challenge is that the total volume of tweets is extremely high, and it takes a long time to process. In this paper, we describe a large-scale distributed system for real-time Twitter sentiment analysis. Our system consists of two components: a lexicon builder and a sentiment classifier. These two components are capable of running on a large-scale distributed system since they are implemented using a MapReduce framework and a distributed database model. Thus, our lexicon builder and sentiment classifier are scalable with the number of machines and the size of data. The experiments also show that our lexicon has a good quality in opinion extraction, and the accuracy of the sentiment classifier can be improved by combining the lexicon with a machine learning technique. © 2012 ACM.",MapReduce; opinion mining; social networks; twitter,Distributed database; Large-scale distributed system; Machine learning techniques; Map-reduce; Opinion extraction; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Social Networks; twitter; Two-component; Data mining; Formal languages; Social networking (online),2-s2.0-84863599306

Text-based query search is the most common approach to retrieve images from the Web. In this approach, the similarity between the input query and the metadata of images is used to find relevant information. However, as the amount of available images grows, the number of relevant images also increases, all of them sharing very similar metadata but differing in other visual characteristics. This paper studies the inuence of visual aesthetic quality in search results as a complementary attribute to relevance. By considering aesthetics, a new ranking parameter is introduced aimed at improving the quality at the top ranks when large amounts of relevant results exist. Two strategies for aesthetic rating inference are proposed: one based on visual content, another based on the analysis of user comments to detect opinions about the quality of images. The results of a user study with 58 participants show that the comment-based aesthetic predictor outperforms the visual content-based strategy, and reveals that aesthetic-aware rankings are preferred by users searching for photographs on the Web.",Image search reranking; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; User comments; Visual aesthetics modeling,Aesthetic qualities; Content-based; Image search; Opinion mining; Re-ranking; Search results; Sentiment analysis; Text-based queries; User comments; User study; Visual content; Data mining; Metadata; Photography; World Wide Web,2-s2.0-84860870468

It is very important and popular in many web applications, such as credibility analysis of news sites on the Web, recommendation system and mining online discussion. Vector space model is widely applied on modeling documents in supervised sentiment classification, in which the feature presentation (including features type and weight function) is crucial for classification accuracy. The traditional feature presentation methods of text categorization do not perform well in sentiment classification, because the expressing manners of sentiment are more subtle. We analyze the relationships of terms with sentiment labels based on information theory, and propose a method by applying information theoretic approach on sentiment classification of documents. In this paper, we adopt mutual information on quantifying the sentiment polarities of terms in a document firstly. Then the terms are weighted in vector space based on both sentiment scores and contribution to the document. We perform extensive experiments with SVM on the sets of multiple product reviews, and the experimental results show our approach is more effective than the traditional ones. © 2012 ACM.",Feature presentation; Information theory; Mutual information; Sentiment classification,Classification accuracy; Feature presentation; Information-theoretic approach; Multiple products; Mutual informations; Online discussions; Polarity classification; Sentiment classification; Text categorization; Vector space models; WEB application; Weight functions; Information theory; Text processing; Vector spaces; Information retrieval systems,2-s2.0-84860577610

The objective is realized by identifying a set of potential features in the review and extracting opinion expressions about those features by exploiting their associations. Capitalizing on the view that more closely associated words come together to express an opinion about a certain feature, dependency parsing is used to identify relations between the opinion expressions. The system learns the set of significant relations to be used by dependency parsing and a threshold parameter which allows us to merge closely associated opinion expressions. The data requirement is minimal as this is a one time learning of the domain independent parameters. The associations are represented in the form of a graph which is partitioned to finally retrieve the opinion expression describing the user specified feature.

This task is of particular difficulty in non-traditional learning environments where students endeavor to design their own projects and engage in a hands-on educational experience. In order to improve our ability to recognize learning in these constructionist environments, this paper reports on an exploratory analysis of learning through multiple modalities: speech, sentiment and drawing. A rich set of features is automatically extracted from the data and used to identify emergent markers of expertise. Some of the most prominent markers of expertise include: user certainty, the ability to describe things efficiently and a disinclination to use unnecessary descriptors or qualifiers. Experts also displayed better organization and used less detail in their drawings. While many of these are things one would expect of an expert, there were areas in which experts looked very similar to novices. To explain this we report on learning theories that can reconcile these seemingly odd findings, and expound on how these domain-independent markers can be useful for identifying student learning over a series of activities.",Assessment; Learning Analytics; Multi-modal; Speech,Assessment; Descriptors; Educational experiences; Exploratory analysis; Learning Analytics; Learning environments; Learning Theory; Multi-modal; Multiple modalities; Non-traditional; Student learning; Data mining; Speech; Students,2-s2.0-84857462441

This issue has been widely studied in recent years, with a prominent approach being based on the application of classification techniques. Basically, messages are classified according to the implicit attitude of the writer with respect to a query term. A major concern, however, is that Twitter (and other media channels) follows the data stream model, and thus the classifier must operate with limited resources, including labeled data for training classification models. This imposes serious challenges for current classification techniques, since they need to be constantly fed with fresh training messages, in order to track sentiment drift and to provide up-to-date sentiment analysis. We propose solutions to this problem. The heart of our approach is a training augmentation procedure which takes as input a small training seed, and then it automatically incorporates new relevant messages to the training data. Classification models are produced on-the-fly using association rules, which are kept up-to-date in an incremental fashion, so that at any given time the model properly reflects the sentiments in the event being analyzed. In order to track sentiment drift, training messages are projected on a demand-driven basis, according to the content of the message being classified. Projecting the training data offers a series of advantages, including the ability to quickly detect trending information emerging in the stream. We performed the analysis of major events in 2010, and we show that the prediction performance remains about the same, or even increases, as the stream passes and new training messages are acquired. This result holds for different languages, even in cases where sentiment distribution changes over time, or in cases where the initial training seed is rather small. We derive lower-bounds for prediction performance, and we show that our approach is extremely effective under diverse learning scenarios, providing gains that range from 7% to 58%.",Sentiment analysis; Sentiment drift; Streams; Twitter,Classification models; Classification technique; Data stream model; Labeled data; Learning scenarios; Major events; Media channel; On-the-fly; Prediction performance; Query terms; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment drift; Small training; Streams; Training data; Twitter; Data mining; Information retrieval; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Classification (of information),2-s2.0-80052131982

Unfortunately, to those outside the field, NDPK is often dismissed as a tiny 'ancient housekeeper' protein found in marine sponges, social amoebae, worms, fruit flies, rodents and humans but the state-of-the-art papers overviewed here show that NDPK does not act simply in mindless rote, inter-converting cellular 'energy currencies'.

This project consists of two waves of data collection. The first set of in-depth interviews with 23 volunteers was conducted in the weeks following the attacks in the fall of 2001. In the second wave of interviews over 3 years later, we interviewed 20 volunteers, nearly half of whom were original respondents in the first wave. Through our analysis, we found that taking action facilitated meaningful therapeutic recovery from feelings of victimization following the event. In addition to the apparent long-term impact on personal healing, the opportunity to volunteer had lasting impacts on self-concept that translated to significant changes in life choices. The second wave of research also reveals that the experience of action impacted the volunteers' community sentiment by fostering new levels of identification with and affinity for members of their community.

This paper proposes that employee turnover can also be a powerful predictor of employee sentiment and resulting customer satisfaction levels. Design/methodology/approach - The relationship between employee satisfaction, employee turnover and customer satisfaction ratings is explored using an extensive data set from a chain of convenience stores. Employee perceptions were obtained from a survey which developed and administered to all store personnel. Turnover data were obtained from archival data. The data are analyzed using path analysis. Findings - The test of various turnover indicators suggests that certain employee turnover indicators can perform as effectively as single-item employee satisfaction ratings do in predicting customer satisfaction. Originality/value - The finding that turnover predicts customer satisfaction as effectively as employee satisfaction is new and has important implications. More attention should be paid to managing customer satisfaction through managing turnover. Also, the use of turnover as an indicator of customer satisfaction should be explored in light of the fact that employee turnover is a naturally collected managerial measure, and does not require the costly administration of employee satisfaction surveys.",Customer satisfaction; Customer services quality; Employee turnover; Human resource management,,2-s2.0-34547473780

It is also a threat to U.S. leadership in the hemisphere and the world. Where has this resentment come from? Has it arisen naturally from imperialism and globalization, from economic and social frustrations? Has it served opportunistic politicians? Does Latin America have its own style of anti Americanism? What about national variations? How does cultural anti Americanism affect politics, and vice versa? What roles have religion, literature, or cartoons played in whipping up sentiment against 'el yanqui'? Finally, how has the United States reacted to all this?. This book brings leaders in the field of U.S. Latin American relations together with the most promising young scholars to shed historical light on the present implications of hostility to the United States in Latin America and the Caribbean. In essays that carry the reader from Revolutionary Mexico to Peronist Argentina, from Panama in the nineteenth century to the West Indies' mid century independence movement, and from Colombian drug runners to liberation theologists, the authors unearth little known campaigns of resistance and probe deeper into episodes we thought we knew well. They argue that, for well over a century, identifying the United States as the enemy has rung true to Latin Americans and has translated into compelling political strategies. Combining history with political and cultural analysis, this collection breaks the mold of traditional diplomatic history by seeing anti Americanism through the eyes of those who expressed it. It makes clear that anti Americanism, far from being a post 9/11 buzzword, is rather a real force that casts a long shadow over U.S. Latin American relations. © 2006, 2008 Alan McPherson.

Hospital visits gave a rhythm to family life. There were changes in the sharing of housework and taking care of affairs, as well as in relationships within the family. Family members spoke of their loneliness, fear and longing. External changes in family life were present in 13% of statements. Helping the patient in hospital involved functions like participation in nursing care, taking the patient to the cafeteria and rehabilitation.

Cuteness communicates power relations and power play, effectively combining weakness, submissiveness and humility with influence, domination and control. It merges meekness, admiration and attachment with benevolence, tenderness and sympathy. This paper focuses on the gendered aspect of cute things: how they communicate messages about being the 'ideal' woman. The multivocality of cuteness is revealed by employing Turner's symbolic analysis and this paper discusses the meanings and cultural values that, embedded in all the varied objects of cuteness, constitute a socionormative commentary about how women should behave, especially vis-a-vis men.

These surveys were undertaken at both the receiving and remitting ends of the process, and bring forth important evidence that remittances are not used exclusively for consumption purposes and play an important role in contributing to both savings and investment in the migrant sending countries. It also shows that remittances appear not to be driven exclusively by altruistic sentiments and the need for family support, but also, among some migrant categories, by the motivation to invest. There appears to be substantial scope for policy intervention on the part of Pacific island governments to increase the flows of remittances into their economies. © 1995, Scalabrini Migration Center.

These services have accumulated a large amount of such geo-tagged review data, which allows deep analysis of user preferences in POIs. This paper studies two types of user preferences to POIs: topical-region preference and category aware topical-aspect preference. We propose a unified probabilistic model to capture these two preferences simultaneously. In addition, our model is capable of capturing the interaction of different factors, including topical aspect, sentiment, and spatial information. The model can be used in a number of applications, such as POI recommendation and user recommendation, among others. In addition, the model enables us to investigate whether people like an aspect of a POI or whether people like a topical aspect of some type of POIs (e.g., bars) in a region, which offer explanation for recommendations. Experiments on real world datasets show that the model achieves significant improvement in POI recommendation and user recommendation in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods. We also propose an efficient online recommendation algorithm based on our model, which saves up to 90% computation time. © 2015 IEEE.",,Computational efficiency; Telecommunication services; Geographical coordinates; Preference analysis; Probabilistic modeling; Real-world datasets; Recommendation algorithms; Spatial informations; State-of-the-art methods; User recommendations; Location based services,2-s2.0-84940839649

ConceptNet based ontology is used to determine the domain specific concepts which in turn produced the domain specific important features. Further, the polarities of the extracted concepts are determined using the contextual polarity lexicon which we developed by considering the context information of a word. Finally, semantic orientations of domain specific features of the review document are aggregated based on the importance of a feature with respect to the domain. The importance of the feature is determined by the depth of the feature in the ontology.

A fundamental question is: how should workers be selected, so that the tasks in hand can be accomplished successfully and economically? In this paper, we study the Jury Selection Problem (JSP): Given a monetary budget, and a set of decision-making tasks (e.g., ""Is Bill Gates still the CEO of Microsoft now?""), return the set of workers (called jury), such that their answers yield the highest ""Jury Quality"" (or JQ). Existing JSP solutions make use of the Majority Voting (MV) strategy, which uses the answer chosen by the largest number of workers. We show that MV does not yield the best solution for JSP. We further prove that among all voting strategies (including deterministic and randomized strategies), Bayesian Voting (BV) can optimally solve JSP. We then examine how to solve JSP based on BV. This is technically challenging, since computing the JQ with BV is NP-hard. We solve this problem by proposing an approximate algorithm that is computationally efficient. Our approximate JQ computation algorithm is also highly accurate, and its error is proved to be bounded within 1%. We extend our solution by considering the task owner's ""belief"" (or prior) on the answers of the tasks. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that our new approach is consistently better than the best JSP solution known. © 2015, Copyright is with the authors.",,Algorithms; Budget control; Crowdsourcing; Decision making; Approximate algorithms; Computation algorithm; Computationally efficient; Entity resolutions; Highly accurate; Randomized strategy; Sentiment analysis; Voting strategies; Optimization,2-s2.0-84976285854

One way to handle contextual polarity is to revise the prior polarity of the sentiment dictionary to fit the domain. This paper presents a data-driven method of adapting sentiment dictionaries to diverse domains. Our method first merges multiple sentiment dictionaries at the entry word level to expand the dictionary. Then, leveraging the ratio of the positive/negative training data, it selectively removes the entry words that do not contribute to the classification. Finally, it selectively switches the sentiment polarity of the entry words to adapt to the domain. In essence, our method compares the positive/negative review's dictionary word occurrence ratios with the positive/negative review ratio itself to determine which entry words to be removed and which entry words' sentiment polarity to be switched.

As a status quo, knowledge on information processing of human agents facing qualitative news is still marginal and mostly unknown. Accordingly, it is crucial to understand how different decision makers process qualitative information in commodity markets. In this paper, we show that sentiment analysis facilitates research in qualitative information processing. We provide empirical evidence that abnormal returns in commodity markets can be explained, up to a large extent, by news sentiment. Further, we contribute to the question of how investors process novel information. Our results suggest that the influence of sentiment is asymmetric - with commodity markets being mostly driven by negative news.

Insights into the full scope of effects may facilitate the implementation and acceptance of innovations because expectations can be made more realistic, and difficulties and pitfalls anticipated. Using workplace-based assessment (WBA) as a reference case, this study aimed to determine which types of effect are perceived by users of innovations in PGME. Methods Focusing on WBA as a recent instance of innovation in PGME, we conducted semi-structured interviews to explore perceptions of the effects of WBA in a purposive sample of Dutch trainees and (lead) consultants in surgical and non-surgical specialties. Interviews conducted in 2011 with 17 participants were analysed thematically using template analysis. To support the exploration of effects outside the domain of education, the study design was informed by theory on the diffusion of innovations. Results Six domains of effects of WBA were identified: sentiments (affinity with the innovation and emotions); dealing with the innovation; specialty training; teaching and learning; workload and tasks, and patient care. Users' affinity with WBA partly determined its effects on teaching and learning. Organisational support and the match between the innovation and routine practice were considered important to minimise additional workload and ensure that WBA was used for relevant rather than easily assessable training activities.

To this end, we performed a qualitative analysis of Twitter posts, as well as an extensive set of interviews with experienced users who post messages on Twitter about exercise, diet, and weight loss activities. The qualitative analysis exposes varying levels of activity actualization and message sentiment. The interviews help us reason about the users practices and motivations for posting activity related to the pursuit and maintenance of volitional health behaviors. Our findings extend existing theoretical frameworks and can inform the design of technology that uses social media to help initiate and maintain challenging activities like exercise and diet.

The IdeaMap® approach presents online, human subjects with a suite of attributes that define a given product. The subjects rate the product as these attributes change in various combinations. Upon analysis, individual attributes of the product, identified as consistently favorable or unfavorable, become apparent. In applying this methodology to strawberries, three-hundred and six subjects representing a broad cross-section of demographics from the United States were surveyed. The subjects rated perceived strawberry fruits based on appearance, texture, health benefits, flavor, point of purchase, and how they were consumed. Results from these experiments define the individual elements of a strawberry that contribute to or detract from an 'ideal' strawberry experience. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that sweetness and complex flavors are the most important attributes, while perceived health benefits had little influence on consumer preference. The point of purchase can have a strong positive or negative effect, depending on the demographic fraction. Additional analysis of these results illustrate that there is not a single, perfect strawberry. Specific likes, dislikes and preferences change with ethnicity, age, gender, urban or suburban location, education and marital status.

The graph-based sentiment (GBS) crawler uses a text classifier that employs both topic and sentiment categorization modules to assess the relevance of candidate pages. This information is also used to label nodes in web graphs that are employed by the tunneling mechanism to improve collection recall. Experimental results on two test beds revealed that GBS was able to provide better precision and recall than seven comparison crawlers. Moreover, GBS was able to collect a large proportion of the relevant content after traversing far fewer pages than comparison methods. GBS outperformed comparison methods on various categories of Web pages in the test beds, including collection of blogs, Web forums, and social networking Web site content. Further analysis revealed that both the sentiment classification module and graph-based tunneling mechanism played an integral role in the overall effectiveness of the GBS crawler. © 2012 ACM.",,Comparison methods; Focused crawler; Graph-based; Overall effectiveness; Precision and recall; Sentiment classification; Text classifiers; Tunneling mechanism; Web content; Web Forums; Web graphs; Web site contents; Equipment testing; Websites; Graphic methods,2-s2.0-84871244231

State-of-the-art studies in cyberbullying detection have mainly focused on the content of the conversations while largely ignoring the users involved in cyberbullying. We propose that incorporation of the users' information, their characteristics, and post-harassing behaviour, for instance, posting a new status in another social network as a reaction to their bullying experience, will improve the accuracy of cyberbullying detection.

With the rapid growth of the user-generated content represented in blogs, wikis and Web forums, such an analysis became a useful tool for mining the Web, since it allowed us to capture sentiments and opinions at a large scale. Opinion retrieval has established itself as an important part of search engines. Ratings, opinion trends and representative opinions enrich the search experience of users when combined with traditional document retrieval, by revealing more insights about a subject. Opinion aggregation over product reviews can be very useful for product marketing and positioning, exposing the customers' attitude towards a product and its features along different dimensions, such as time, geographical location, and experience. Tracking howopinions or discussions evolve over time can help us identify interesting trends and patterns and better understand the ways that information is propagated in the Internet.

While the polarity of words in the documents is informative for this task, polarity of some words cannot be determined without domain knowledge. Detecting word polarity thus poses a challenge for multiple-domain sentiment analysis. Previous approaches tackle this problem with transfer learning techniques, but they cannot handle multiple source domains and multiple target domains. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian probabilistic model to handle multiple source and multiple target domains. In this model, each word is associated with three factors: Domain label, domain dependence/independence and word polarity. We derive an efficient algorithm using Gibbs sampling for inferring the parameters of the model, from both labeled and unlabeled texts. Using real data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in a document polarity classification task compared with a method not considering the differences between domains. Moreover our method can also tell whether each word's polarity is domain-dependent or domain-independent. This feature allows us to construct a word polarity dictionary for each domain.

Using data collected from residents of six communities in Washington State, network analysis combined with negative binomial regression is used to determine the effect of personal networks and community networks on community attachment and satisfaction. Findings suggest that while individual-level variables, such as length of residence and individual ties, affect one's attachment to community, a community's network structure does not significantly affect community attachment.

The Court is uniquely positioned to enhance or inhibit political reform, enshrine or dismantle social inequalities, and expand or suppress individual rights. Yet despite claims of victory from judicial activists and complaints of undemocratic lawmaking from the Court’s critics, numerous studies of the Court assert that it wields little real power. This book examines the nature of Supreme Court power by identifying conditions under which the Court is successful at altering the behavior of state and private actors. Employing a series of longitudinal studies that use quantitative measures of behavior outcomes across a wide range of issue areas, it develops and supports a new theory of Supreme Court power. Matthew E. K. Hall finds that the Court tends to exercise power successfully when lower courts can directly implement its rulings; however, when the Court must rely on non-court actors to implement its decisions, its success depends on the popularity of those decisions. Overall, this theory depicts the Court as a powerful institution, capable of exerting significant influence over social change. Reviews: “Matthew Hall’s The Nature of Supreme Court Power is must reading for scholars and students interested in the impact of Supreme Court decisions and American politics generally. By carefully focusing attention on behavior in society a decision could be expected to change, Hall articulates vertical and lateral contingencies that condition the Court’s influence, and alerts us to the important role of an issue’s public popularity. He makes a convincing case for when we should and should not find Supreme Court influence, and backs this up with careful empirical support. His findings that the Court is not all-powerful but strikingly powerful under certain conditions will figure prominently in the important debate about the power of that institution.” —Paul Brace, Rice University “This is the best treatment of the nature of Supreme Court power since Gerald Rosenberg’s The Hollow Hope, and it paints a very different picture. Hall’s elegant argument is likely to unsettle a number of widespread scholarly assumptions about the Court.” —Thomas M. Keck, Syracuse University “The Nature of Supreme Court Power is one of the most important contributions to our understanding of the power of courts in the last three decades. Hall convincingly argues that judicial power to affect the behavior of state and private actors depends on more than the law itself. His careful analysis demonstrates the importance of institutional context and popular sentiment as well as lower court's capacity to implement decisions. This terrific book will be of interest to seasoned scholars and court watchers interested in the interplay of law and politics.” —Laura Beth Nielsen, American Bar Foundation and Northwestern University “In this engaging book, Hall challenges much conventional wisdom about the limits of judicial power. Ranging widely over controversial Supreme Court decisions of the last 50 years, Hall’s argument may give pause to judicial power skeptics. Well-researched and clearly argued, The Nature of Supreme Court Power deserves to be widely read and taught.” —Gerald N. Rosenberg, University of Chicago ""Matthew Hall's The Nature of the Supreme Court Power is a significant contribution…Hall writes in a craftsman-like fashion producing a highly readable volume…The book stimulates a wide variety of unanswered substantive and theoretical questions and will undoubtedly encourage additional research efforts""- Thomas G.

This theory claims that any language of design consists of a set of symbols, a set of relations between the symbols, features that key the expressiveness of symbols, and a set of reality producing information processing behaviors acting on the language. Drawing upon insights from computational language processing, the language of design is modeled computationally through latent semantic analysis (LSA), lexical chain analysis (LCA), and sentiment analysis (SA). The statistical co-occurrence of semantics (LSA), semantic relations (LCA), and semantic modifiers (SA) in design text are used to illustrate how the reality producing effect of language is itself an enactment of design. This insight leads to a new understanding of the connections between creative behaviors such as design and their linguistic properties. The computation of the language of design makes it possible to make direct measurements of creative behaviors which are distributed across social spaces and mediated through language.

This study examines the relationship between investor behavior and stock returns focusing on Japanese margin transactions using weekly data from 1994 to 2003. Margin trading is dominated by individual investors in Japan. In analysis at the firm level, we find a significant cross-sectional relationship between margin buying and stock returns. Both market-level and firm-level analyses show that margin buying traders follow herding behavior. They seem to follow positive feedback trading behavior for small-firm stocks and negative feedback trading behavior for large firm stocks. Our results show that information about margin buying helps predict future stock returns, especially for small-firm stocks at short horizons. The predictive power does not diminish even after controlling for firm size and liquidity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Our focus is to compare three types of waste-disposal behaviors and derive specific interventions. The behaviors most suitable to Cuba are recycling, composting, and reuse. Analysis with structural equation modeling (SEM) reveals relevant differences in factor influence for attitude components and perceived reputation. Recycling and composting are most strongly influenced by affective aspects of attitude, whereas the general attitude toward reuse seems to have a more rational basis. The influence of perceived reputation on recycling is strong, that on composting is moderate, and no influence at all is found for reuse. The authors combine the SEM results with those of the qualitative data analysis of problems and incentives assessed from the participants and suggest behavior-specific interventions. © 2008 Sage Publications.",Behavior change; Cuba; Intervention; Structural equation modeling; Waste,anthropogenic effect; behavioral response; composting; public attitude; recycling; waste disposal; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Caribbean Islands; Cuba; Greater Antilles,2-s2.0-45249084782

Seventy-two victims and offenders participated in a community group conference model of restorative justice and were compared on outcome variables with a control group of victims and offenders who underwent a conventional court process. Results demonstrate that the process is capable of impacting upon variables associated with the criminal act.

A direct comparison is conducted on firm's viable choices on a comprehensive sample of corporate divestiture transactions in the period of 1985-1998. Our multinomial logit analysis provides a complete picture on corporate divestitures. We find that, in support for the focusing hypothesis, highly diversified firms are more likely to divest units when suffering from low operating efficiency. Our results are also consistent with the proposition that firms are divesting to relax their credit constraint, as firms with higher leverage ratios and low cash income are more likely to engage in carveouts or selloffs. We find limited evidence of information asymmetry as the major determinant of divestitures. We provide new findings on firm's choice among the three divestiture options. We report that, conditioned on the decision to divest, firms mainly use asset selloffs in divesting smaller units operating in the same industry. Firms with larger divested units are more likely to use spinoff or carveout transactions. Parent firms having high revenue growth, high book-to-market ratio, and divesting unit when market sentiment is high are less likely to use spinoffs. Firms having high dividend yield, less information asymmetry, and divesting units operating in different industries are more likely to use carveout as an exit mechanism.

By adapting and applying David Korten's (1990) typology of NGOs, the author undertakes a comparative analysis of NGOs in Hong Kong that are involved with the improvement of foreign workers' rights and welfare. The argument is that the different strategies adopted by the NGOs have wrought social changes in diverse ways, from the provision of welfare assistance to the mass mobilisation of workers, in both sending and receiving countries.

They are rather by-product feelings afforded by the context of pursuing ordinary tastes. The evaluation of one's 'performance' in light of one's estimated ability originates the feeling of respect (or its opposite, embarrassment). The evaluation of one's 'ability' in comparison to the abilities of others determines the degree of admiration.

Multiple regression analysis of the cross-sectional data—which cover 68 countries for the period 1956—1965—revealed that both internal stress and U.S. penetration affect anti-Americanism independently, with internal stress being a stronger determinant of anti-Americanism than U.S. penetration. When the countries were grouped together in regional clusters, stress was more important in generating European and Latin American anti-Americanism, while, in the Afro-Asian nations, U.S. presence was more important. Longitudinal data were collected and analyzed for Canada and Mexico, each for the period 1936-1968. Both simultaneous and time-lagged multiple regressions again showed stress and penetration as independent determinants of anti-Americanism. While, in Canada, U.S. presence was a stronger determinant of anti-Americanism than was stress, stress was more influential in generating Mexican anti-U.S. sentiments.

Even though there are many on-line platforms which perform sentiment analysis, there is no publicly available interactive on-line platform for dynamic adaptive sentiment analysis, which would be able to handle changes in data streams and adapt its behavior over time. This paper describes ClowdFlows, a cloud-based scientific workflow platform, and its extensions enabling the analysis of data streams and active learning. Moreover, by utilizing the data and workflow sharing in ClowdFlows, the labeling of examples can be distributed through crowdsourcing.

Harvesting opinions through sentiment analysis from people with different backgrounds and from different cultures via social media platforms can help modern organizations, including corporations and governments understand customers, make decisions, and develop strategies. However, multiple languages posted on many social media platforms make it difficult to perform a sentiment analysis with acceptable levels of accuracy and consistency. In this paper, we propose a bilingual approach to conducting sentiment analysis on both Chinese and English social media to obtain more objective and consistent opinions. Instead of processing English and Chinese comments separately, our approach treats review comments as a stream of text containing both Chinese and English words. That stream of text is then segmented by our segment model and trimmed by the stop word lists which include both Chinese and English words. The stem words are then processed into feature vectors and then applied with two exchangeable natural language models, SVM and N-Gram. Finally, we perform a case study, applying our proposed approach to analyzing movie reviews obtained from social media.

For example, instead of creating separate grammar symbols to mark the definiteness of an NP, our parser might instead capture the same information from the first word of the NP. Moving context out of the grammar and onto surface features can greatly simplify the structural component of the parser: because so many deep syntactic cues have surface reflexes, our system can still parse accurately with context-free backbones as minimal as Xbar grammars. Keeping the structural backbone simple and moving features to the surface also allows easy adaptation to new languages and even to new tasks.

This article develops a preliminary theory of marketplace sentiments. Defined as collectively shared emotional dispositions, sentiments can be grouped into three functionbased categories: contempt for villains, concern for victims, and celebration of heroes. Marketplace actors such as activists, brands, and consumers have a variety of motives and methods for producing and reproducing sentiments. Activists plant, amplify, and hyper-perform sentiments to recruit consumers and discipline institutions. Brands carefully select, calibrate, and broadcast sentiments toentertain consumers and promote products. Consumers learn, experience, and communicate sentiments to commune and individuate in society. The emergent theory of marketplace sentiments (1) advances a sociocultural perspective on consumer emotion, (2) elevates the theoretical significance of emotional observations in cultural studies, (3) offers a sentiment-based understanding of the power of ideology, (4) indicates how activist sentiments can paradoxically benefit from brand cooptation, and (5) calls for human input in big data sentiment analysis. More broadly, the article proposes that cultures are systems of discourses, sentiments, and practices wherein discourses legitimize sentiments and practices, sentiments energize discourses and practices, and practices materialize discourses and sentiments. © 2014 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc.

Nonetheless, they do provide an interesting guide for the researchers in their on-going efforts to improve lexicon-based SA.

Despite these great avails, and with the increasingly enormous number of Arabic users on the internet, little research has tied these two together in a high and accurate professional manner [1]. This paper deals with Arabic Sentiment Analysis. We developed a framework that makes it possible to analyze Twitter comments or 'Tweets' as having positive, negative or neutral sentiments. This can be applied in a wide range of applications ranging from politics to marketing. This framework has many novel aspects such as handling Arabic dialects, Arabizi and emoticons.

Information is generated and managed through either computer or mobile devices by one person and is consumed by many other persons, with most of this user-generated content being textual information. As there are a lot of raw data of people posting real time messages about their opinions on a variety of topics in daily life, it is a worthwhile research endeavor to collect and analyze these data, which may be useful for users or managers to make informed decisions, for example. However this problem is challenging because a micro-blog post is usually very short and colloquial, and traditional opinion mining algorithms do not work well in such type of text. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new system architecture that can automatically analyze the sentiments of these messages. We combine this system with manually annotated data from Twitter, one of the most popular microblogging platforms, for the task of sentiment analysis. In this system, machines can learn how to automatically extract the set of messages which contain opinions, filter out non- opinion messages and determine their sentiment directions (i.e. positive, negative). Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our system on sentiment analysis in real microblogging applications. © 2013 IEEE.",Microblogging; Opinion Mining; Sentiment analysis,Communication tools; Micro-blogging platforms; Microblogging; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; System architectures; Textual information; User-generated content; Algorithms; Information management; Mobile devices; Social networking (online); Data mining,2-s2.0-84883513380

We examined the neural precursors of spreading ideas with enthusiasm, and dissect enthusiasm into component processes that can be identified through automated linguistic analysis, gestalt human ratings of combined linguistic and non-verbal cues, and points of convergence/divergence between the two. We combined tools from natural language processing with data gathered using fMRI, to link the neurocognitive mechanisms that are set in motion during initial exposure to ideas and subsequent behaviors of these message communicators outside of the scanner. Participants' neural activity was recorded as they reviewed ideas for potential television show pilots. Participants' language from video-taped interviews collected post-scan was transcribed and given to an automated linguistic sentiment analysis classifier, which returned ratings for evaluative language (evaluative vs. descriptive) and valence (positive vs. negative). Separately, human coders rated the enthusiasm with which participants transmitted each idea. More positive sentiment ratings by the automated classifier were associated with activation in neural regions including medial prefrontal cortex; MPFC, precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex; PC/PCC, and medial temporal lobe; MTL. More evaluative, positive, descriptions were associated exclusively with neural activity in temporal parietal junction (TPJ). Finally, human ratings indicative of more enthusiastic sentiment were associated with activation across these regions (MPFC, PC/PCC, DMPFC, TPJ, MTL) as well as in ventral striatum, inferior parietal lobule and premotor cortex. Taken together, these data demonstrate novel links between neural activity during initial idea encoding and the enthusiasm with which the ideas are subsequently delivered. These data also demonstrate the novel use of machine learning tools to link natural language data to neuroimaging data. © 2012 Falk, O_donnell and Lieberman.",Enthusiasm; FMRI; Information diffusion; Natural Language Processing; Self-related processing; Sentiment analysis; Social cognition,adult; association; behavior; classifier; cognition; corpus striatum; enthusiasm; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; inferior parietal lobule; interpersonal communication; interview; linguistics; male; medial prefrontal cortex; natural language processing; normal human; posterior cingulate; precuneus; prefrontal cortex; premotor cortex; review; temporal lobe,2-s2.0-84933670819

Both are language-neutral and noise-tolerant, guaranteeing high effectiveness and robustness in the settings we are considering. To ensure our approach can be integrated into practical applications with large volumes of data, we also aim at enhancing its time efficiency: we propose alternative sets of features with low extraction cost, explore dimensionality reduction and discretization techniques and experiment with multiple classification algorithms.

OBJECTIVE: To identify opportunities for physicians to engage in ACP discussions and to characterize physicians' responses to these opportunities. DESIGN: Qualitative study of audio-recorded outpatient clinic visits. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-two patients≥65 years recently hospitalized for HF with one or more post-discharge follow-up outpatient visits, and their physicians (n=44), at two Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. APPROACH: Using content analysis methods, we analyzed and coded transcripts of outpatient follow-up visits for 1) patient statements pertaining to their future health or their future physical, psychosocial and spiritual/ existential care needs, and 2) subsequent physician responses to patient statements, using an iterative consensus-based coding process. RESULTS: In 13 of 71 consultations, patients expressed concerns, questions, and thoughts regarding their future care that gave providers opportunities to engage in an ACP discussion. The majority of these opportunities (84%) were missed by physicians. Instead, physicians responded by terminating the conversation, hedging their responses, denying the patient's expressed emotion, or inadequately acknowledging the sentiment underlying the patient's statement. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians often missed the opportunity to engage in ACP despite openers patients provided that could have prompted such discussions. Communication training efforts should focus on helping physicians identify patient openers and providing a toolbox to encourage appropriate physician responses; in order to successfully leverage opportunities to engage in ACP discussions. © Society of General Internal Medicine 2011.",Advance care planning; Heart failure; Physician-patient communication; Qualitative research,aged; article; audio recording; consensus development; consultation; content analysis; controlled study; disease course; doctor patient relation; emotion; existentialism; female; follow up; health care need; health care personnel; health care planning; heart failure; human; major clinical study; male; outpatient care; patient care; physician; psychosocial care; qualitative research; spiritual care; Advance Directives; Aged; Communication; Female; Heart Failure; Humans; Male; Office Visits; Outpatients; Professional-Patient Relations; Qualitative Research; Quality of Health Care; Tape Recording; United States,2-s2.0-84862508632

In this paper, a novel method based on Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) is presented to model the hidden sentiment factors and an emotion-oriented clustering approach is proposed to find common emotions according to the fine-grained sentiment similarity between blogs. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world datasets consisting of different topics. The results show that our approach can partition blogs into sentiment coherent clusters and the extracted common emotion words afford good navigation guidelines for embedded sentiments in each cluster. © 2010 Springer-Verlag London Limited.",Opinion mining; PLSA; Sentiment analysis,,2-s2.0-79955050285

We propose a method to find the interest group based on topic content analysis, which combine the advantages of clustering and classification algorithms. Then we use the method of sentiment analysis to define the authority value as the weight of the link between users.

Data were collected through semistructured interviews. A qualitative content analysis method was used to analyze the gathered data. The analysis resulted in the emergence of six themes and seven subthemes: confronting the disease using religious sentiment, seeking support, fighting the disease, defending oneself against the disease, concealing the disease, and expressing emotions. The findings showed that the participants used an emotion-focused approach more often than a problem-focused approach as a coping strategy.

This clustering effect is not due to market liquidity or other structural characteristics, but instead can be explained by cross-country variation in the degree of private property rights protection.

Although nations habitually put forward the tangible benefits that such events are likely to bring as justification for hosting them, not many analyses have sought to explore the processes through which the more elusive benefits are said to accrue, namely, identity formation and signalling aspects, on the one hand, and democracy and human rights enhancing aspects on the other. Through this analysis it is demonstrated how South Africa has traditionally drawn from the realm of politics using its perceived moral authority for hosting such events, yet the folding of the overtly political into the sporting arena has sometimes led to unintended consequences. South Africa has also become much more businesslike in its approach to sports events. Whereas the Rugby and Cricket World Cups were steeped in the symbolic importance of an 'imagined community', these sentiments are likely to become diluted in the face of a more consumerist global football milieu and the powerful role of FIFA in deciding who gets what, when and where.",,,2-s2.0-34547472694

This work aims at quantifying the effect of sentiment on information diffusion, to understand: (i) whether positive conversations spread faster and/or broader than negative ones (or vice-versa); (ii) what kind of emotions are more typical of popular conversations on social media; and, (iii) what type of sentiment is expressed in conversations characterized by different temporal dynamics. Our findings show that, at the level of contents, negative messages spread faster than positive ones, but positive ones reach larger audiences, suggesting that people are more inclined to share and favorite positive contents, the so-called positive bias. As for the entire conversations, we highlight how different temporal dynamics exhibit different sentiment patterns: for example, positive sentiment builds up for highly-anticipated events, while unexpected events are mainly characterized by negative sentiment.

Online social media and associated social networks are an increasingly important forum for public debate and are known to influence individual attitudes and behaviours - yet online discussions and social networks related to climate change are not well understood. Here we construct several forms of social network for users communicating about climate change on the popular microblogging platform Twitter. We classify user attitudes to climate change based on message content and find that social networks are characterised by strong attitude-based homophily and segregation into polarised ""sceptic"" and ""activist"" groups. Most users interact only with like-minded others, in communities dominated by a single view. However, we also find mixed-attitude communities in which sceptics and activists frequently interact. Messages between like-minded users typically carry positive sentiment, while messages between sceptics and activists carry negative sentiment. We identify a number of general patterns in user behaviours relating to engagement with alternative views. Users who express negative sentiment are themselves the target of negativity. Users in mixed-attitude communities are less likely to hold a strongly polarised view, but more likely to express negative sentiment towards other users with differing views. Overall, social media discussions of climate change often occur within polarising ""echo chambers"", but also within ""open forums"", mixed-attitude communities that reduce polarisation and stimulate debate.

As in other supervised learning tasks such as binary or multiclass classification, feature selection is often needed in order to improve efficiency and avoid overfitting. However, although feature selection has been extensively studied for other classification tasks, it has not for ordinal classification. In this letter, we present six novel feature selectionmethods that we have specifically devised for ordinal classification and test them on two data sets of product review data against three methods previously known from the literature, using two learning algorithms from the support vector regression tradition.

In this paper we present an innovation to current VAA design which is based on the introduction of a social network element. We refer to this new type of online tool as a social voting advice application (SVAA). SVAAs extend VAAs by providing (a) community-based recommendations, (b) comparison of users' political opinions, and (c) a channel of user communication. In addition, SVAAs enriched with data mining modules, can operate as citizen sensors recording the sentiment of the electorate on issues and candidates. Drawing on VAA datasets generated by the Preference Matcher research consortium, we evaluate the results of the first VAA-Choose4Greece- which incorporated social voting features and was launched during the landmark Greek national elections of 2012. We demonstrate how an SVAA can provide community based features and, at the same time, serve as a citizen sensor.

It may be that no simple function of the labels on the individual words captures the overall emotion of the sentence; words are interrelated and they mutually influence their affect-related interpretation. It happens quite often that a word which invokes emotion appears in a neutral sentence, or that a sentence with no emotional word carries an emotion. This could also happen among different emotion classes. The goal of this work is to distinguish automatically between prior and contextual emotion, with a focus on exploring features important in this task. We present a set of features which enable us to take the contextual emotion of a word and the syntactic structure of the sentence into account to put sentences into emotion classes. The evaluation includes assessing the performance of different feature sets across multiple classification methods. We show the features and a promising learning method which significantly outperforms two reasonable baselines. We group our features by the similarity of their nature.

A great share of current sentiment analysis approaches makes use of special purpose lexicons that provide information about the polarity (e.g., positive or negative) of individual words and phrases. One major challenge is that the actual sentiment polarity of a specific expression is often context dependent (e.g., ""long+ battery life"" vs. ""long- flash recycle time""). However, the vast majority of existing approaches focuses on creating general purpose lexicons. Especially in the context of mining customer review data, the use of such lexicons is rather suboptimal as they fail to adequately reflect the domain specific lexical usage. We propose a novel method that allows to automatically adapt and extend existing lexicons to a specific product domain. We follow a corpus-based approach and exploit the fact that many customer reviews exhibit some form of semi-structure. The method is fully automatic and thus scales well across different product domains. Our experiments show that the extracted lexicons are highly accurate and significantly improve the performance in a sentiment classification scenario.

Previous related research mainly relied on explicit features but ignored implicit features. However, the implicit features, which are implied by some words or phrases, are so significant that they can express the users' opinion and help us to better understand the users' comments. It is a big challenge to detect these implicit features in Chinese product reviews, due to the complexity of Chinese. This paper is mainly centered on implicit features identification in Chinese product reviews. A novel hybrid association rule mining method is proposed for this task. The core idea of this approach is mining as many association rules as possible via several complementary algorithms. Firstly, we extract candidate feature indicators based word segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging and feature clustering, then compute the co-occurrence degree between the candidate feature indicators and the feature words using five collocation extraction algorithms. Each indicator and the corresponding feature word constitute a rule (feature indicator → feature word). The best rules in five different rule sets are chosen as the basic rules. Next, three methods are proposed to mine some possible reasonable rules from the lower co-occurrence feature indicators and non indicator words. Finally, the latest rules are used to identify implicit features and the results are compared with the previous. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed approach is competent at the task, especially via using several expanding methods. The recall is effectively improved, suggesting that the shortcomings of the basic rules have been overcome to certain extent. Besides those high co-occurrence degree indicators, the final rules also contain uncommon rules. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This research presents the results of three studies designed to investigate the effect of ""individualizing"" the problem of childhood obesity, in combination with information about causes of obesity, on public support for obesity prevention policies (Studies 1 and 2) and to examine how frequently the news media rely on individual depictions of obese children to portray the problem in actual news coverage (Study 3). Results from two experiments consistently demonstrated that, regardless of how the cause of childhood obesity was framed, when a news report identified an individual obese child, participants were less likely to support prevention policies than when the report described the problem in more general terms. A content analysis indicated that news articles relatively infrequently frame the problem using individualized depictions of a specific child. When specific overweight or obese children were mentioned, news coverage emphasized internal (behavioral and genetic) causes rather than factors external to the child such as neighborhood, economic, or food-industry factors. Findings underscore the importance of considering attitudes toward a policy's target population when assessing how individual depictions of a policy problem influence public sentiment. © 2013 International Society of Political Psychology.",Childhood obesity; Framing; Policy; Public opinion,,2-s2.0-84878176374

For each step, we study the performance of a number of classical and new machine learning algorithms.

In addition, we present weighted variants of all employed algorithms, exploiting the available labeling uncertainty, which further improve classification accuracy.

In the first stage, topic factor and user influence are integrated to generate users' influential relationship based on different topics; in the second stage, users' historical messages and social interaction records are leveraged by TOIM to construct their historical opinions and neighbors' opinion influence through a statistical learning process, which can be further utilized to predict users' future opinions on some specific topics. We evaluate our TOIM on a large-scaled dataset from Tencent Weibo, one of the largest microbloggings website in China. The experimental results show that TOIM can better predict users' opinion than other baseline methods. © 2012 ACM.",opinion mining; sentiment analysis; social influence; topic modeling,Baseline methods; Data sets; Influence model; Learning process; Micro-blog; Opinion mining; Probabilistic models; Sentiment analysis; Social influence; Social interactions; Statistical learning; Data mining; Data processing; Knowledge management; Economic and social effects,2-s2.0-84871042217

However, sentiment analysis for Twitter messages ('tweets') is regarded as a challenging problem because tweets are short and informal. In this paper, we apply a novel approach for automatically classifying the sentiment and emotions of Twitter messages. These messages are hierarchically categorized on basis of neutrality, polarity (positive or negative) and presence of various emotions. The hierarchical classification approach (HC) is a specialization of the well-known flat classification task. The main difference between them is that when using HC, examples must be assigned to classes organized in a previously defined class hierarchy, while traditional flat classification does not take into account the hierarchical information. We applied our model to posts collected from Twitter regarding the 2011 season of the Brazilian Soccer League. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms the corresponding flat approach in emotion classification. © 2012 IEEE.",hierarchical classification; sentiment and emotions classification; Twitter,Class hierarchies; Classification tasks; Emotion classification; Emotion recognition; Hierarchical classification; Hierarchical information; Sentiment analysis; Twitter; Classification (of information); Learning systems; Social networking (online),2-s2.0-84873578641

Our empirical analysis of three largest Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) contracts in the U.S. suggests that there is a significant positive feedback trading in these markets and the intensity of which is generally linked to investor sentiment. Specifically, the level of feedback trading tends to increase when investors are optimistic. In addition, we find that the influence of sentiment on feedback trading varies across market regimes. These results are consistent with the view that feedback trading activity is largely caused by the presence of sentiment-driven noise trading.

Understanding the structure of threads and the sentiment of the participants' interaction is valuable for search and moderation of newsgroups. In this paper, we focus on automatic classification of message replies into several types. For representing messages we consider rich feature sets that combine the standard author reply-to network properties with features derived from four additional structures identified in the data: 1) a network of authors who participate in the same threads, 2) network of authors who post similar content, 3) network of threads sharing common authors, and 4) network of content-related threads. For selected newsgroups we train linear SVM classifiers to identify agreement and disagreement with the original message, and question and answer patterns in the threads. We show that the use of newly defined features substantially improves classification of messages in comparison with the SVM model based only on the standard reply-to network.

It argues that PMPI embody a particular type of “mediatized intellectual” whose public discourse on Muslims is crucial in determining how issues emerging from the politics of multiculturalism are understood. Adopting a “theory of argumentation” (Richardson, 2001) derived from a critical discourse analysis methodology (CDA), it investigates the political content of messages disseminated by (1) conservative nationalist and (2) secular liberal PMPI through their newspaper opinion columns. The findings suggest that PMPI argumentation ranges from an overt hostility to a qualified discrimination (the former through exclusive accounts of belonging and the latter through a combative/civilising liberalism), and that—moreover—there is a convergence between these two positions in their anti-Muslim sentiment and desire to regulate the lives of ethnic Others (Hage, 1998). There are four parts to this article: the first part outlines what a public intellectual is and where PMPI stand in relation to this; the second part discusses some Muslim attempts to elicit forms of recognition from the state under a rubric of multiculturalism; the third part outlines the chosen CDA schema of analyses and PMPI output; and the fourth part concludes by encouraging us to recognise and examine further the importance of PMPI argumentation in public discourse. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Discourse analysis; Foucault; Journalists; Multiculturalism; Muslims; Print-media; Public intellectuals,,2-s2.0-84971304126

The implication is that such conflicts belong to a general type of ethnic conflict with certain repeated and predictable features. This type of conflict is seen as being motivated by ethnic sentiments, as being grounded in deeply set hatreds, and as being virtually inescapable. By applying the epithet ""ethnic,"" it is as if the conflict were already explained. However, there are many reasons to be suspicious of these implications. Ethnic groups presently embroiled in fierce conflict may have been, at a previous point in time, peacefully co-existent. Frequently, the very lines of ethnic difference become blurred through intermarriage and cultural change. Therefore, in order to understand conflict described as ""ethnic"" we need to uncover the reasons why (in a given conflict situation) there is heightened awareness of ethnic difference. Then we need to explain what I have termed ""the conditions of ethnicity,"" that is, the external conditions which lead to severe conflict; and those external circumstances that make it likely that the conflict will follow lines of ethnic differentiation. Two of these conditions are the strength of the state system and the ability of the state to manage ethnic conflict.

From a policy perspective, current and projected growth in aviation is fundamentally incompatible with radical emissions reduction and decarbonisation of the global energy system. Efforts to address the aviation-climate change 'policy clash' must be informed by an understanding of public sentiments towards climate change, air travel and carbon mitigation. This article examines how consumers across four western nations are responding to the environmental excesses of contemporary air travel consumption. It focuses on individual receptiveness to voluntarily measures aimed at changing flying behaviours, industry responses and degrees of government regulation. Its theoretical context harnesses lessons from public health to inform a discussion of bottom up (social marketing, nudge) and top down (government regulation) approaches to the urgent challenge of radical air travel emissions reduction. The findings of its comparative empirical analysis are presented, based upon 68 in-depth interviews conducted in Norway, the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia. We highlight contrasts in how consumers are beginning to internalise and process the environmental excesses of contemporary air travel consumption. Whereas voluntary measures, such as carbon off-setting, are viewed with widespread scepticism, divergence was found across the four study contexts in willingness to accept regulatory measures. Norwegians were far more willing to accommodate strong government intervention through taxation, whereas participants from the other three nations favoured softer strategies that are not perceived as restricting individual freedoms to travel. We conclude that voluntary approaches will be insufficient alone, and that behavioural change in public flying behaviour requires diverse policy measures. These must be informed by insights into the public's willingness to palate stronger mitigation interventions, which varies within and between societies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Aviation; Behaviour change; Emissions; Nudge; Public health; Social marketing,Aviation; Civil aviation; Commerce; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Marketing; Particulate emissions; Public health; Public policy; Taxation; Behaviour changes; Behavioural changes; Emissions reduction; Government intervention; Government regulation; Nudge; Social marketings; Willingness to accept; Climate change,2-s2.0-84945460194

In this paper we identify and discuss the growing opportunities for cross-disciplinary work that may increase individual advances. Sentiment/opinion detection methods used in human-agent interaction are indeed rare and, when they are employed, they are not different from the ones used in opinion mining and consequently not designed for socio-affective interactions (timing constraint of the interaction, sentiment analysis as an input and an output of interaction strategies). To support our claims, we present a comparative state of the art which analyzes the sentiment-related phenomena and the sentiment detection methods used in both communities and makes an overview of the goals of socio-affective human-agent strategies. We propose then different possibilities for mutual benefit, specifying several research tracks and discussing the open questions and prospects.

However, the performance of BOW sometimes remains limited due to some fundamental deficiencies in handling the polarity shift problem. We propose a model called dual sentiment analysis (DSA), to address this problem for sentiment classification. We first propose a novel data expansion technique by creating a sentiment-reversed review for each training and test review. On this basis, we propose a dual training algorithm to make use of original and reversed training reviews in pairs for learning a sentiment classifier, and a dual prediction algorithm to classify the test reviews by considering two sides of one review. We also extend the DSA framework from polarity (positive-negative) classification to 3-class (positive-negative-neutral) classification, by taking the neutral reviews into consideration. Finally, we develop a corpus-based method to construct a pseudo-antonym dictionary, which removes DSA's dependency on an external antonym dictionary for review reversion. We conduct a wide range of experiments including two tasks, nine datasets, two antonym dictionaries, three classification algorithms, and two types of features. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of DSA in supervised sentiment classification. © 2015 IEEE.",machine learning; natural language processing; opinion mining; sentiment analysis,Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Information retrieval; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Classification algorithm; Corpus-based methods; NAtural language processing; Opinion mining; Prediction algorithms; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Statistical machine learning; Classification (of information),2-s2.0-84936966486

Common feature engineering techniques frequently result in a large numbers of features being generated to represent tweets. Many of these features may degrade classifier performance and increasing computational cost. Feature selection techniques can be used to select an optimal subset of features, reducing the computational cost of training a classifier, and potentially improving classification performance. Despite its benefits, feature selection has received little attention within the tweet sentiment domain. We study the impact of ten filter-based feature selection techniques on classification performance, using ten feature subset sizes and four different learners. Our experimental results demonstrate that feature selection can significantly improve classification performance in comparison to not using feature selection. Additionally, both choice of ranker and feature subset size significantly impact classifier performance.

To better understand trends in e-cigarette attitudes and behaviors, public health and communication professionals can turn to the dialogue taking place on popular social media platforms such as Twitter. Objective: The objective of this study was to conduct a content analysis to identify key conversation trends and patterns over time using historical Twitter data. Methods: A 5-category content analysis was conducted on a random sample of tweets chosen from all publicly available tweets sent between May 1, 2013, and April 30, 2014, that matched strategic keywords related to e-cigarettes. Relevant tweets were isolated from the random sample of approximately 10,000 tweets and classified according to sentiment, user description, genre, and theme. Descriptive analyses including univariate and bivariate associations, as well as correlation analyses were performed on all categories in order to identify patterns and trends. Results: The analysis revealed an increase in e-cigarette-related tweets from May 2013 through April 2014, with tweets generally being positive; 71% of the sample tweets were classified as having a positive sentiment. The top two user categories were everyday people (65%) and individuals who are part of the e-cigarette community movement (16%). These two user groups were responsible for a majority of informational (79%) and news tweets (75%), compared to reputable news sources and foundations or organizations, which combined provided 5% of informational tweets and 12% of news tweets. Personal opinion (28%), marketing (21%), and first person e-cigarette use or intent (20%) were the three most common genres of tweets, which tended to have a positive sentiment. Marketing was the most common theme (26%), and policy and government was the second most common theme (20%), with 86% of these tweets coming from everyday people and the e-cigarette community movement combined, compared to 5% of policy and government tweets coming from government, reputable news sources, and foundations or organizations combined. Conclusions: Everyday people and the e-cigarette community are dominant forces across several genres and themes, warranting continued monitoring to understand trends and their implications regarding public opinion, e-cigarette use, and smoking cessation. Analyzing social media trends is a meaningful way to inform public health practitioners of current sentiments regarding e-cigarettes, and this study contributes a replicable methodology. © Heather Cole-Lewis, Jillian Pugatch, Amy Sanders, Arun Varghese, Susana Posada, Christopher Yun, Mary Schwarz, Erik Augustson.",Content analysis; E-cigarettes; Social media; Twitter,electronic cigarette; female; human; Internet; public opinion; smoking cessation; social media; United States; utilization; Electronic Cigarettes; Female; Humans; Internet; Public Opinion; Smoking Cessation; Social Media; United States,2-s2.0-84946718495

Annotated sentiment corpora are the most important resources used in sentiment classification. However, since most recent research works in this field have focused on the English language, there are accordingly not enough annotated sentiment resources in other languages. Manual construction of reliable annotated sentiment corpora for a new language is a labour-intensive and time-consuming task. Projection of sentiment corpus from one language into another language is a natural solution used in cross-lingual sentiment classification. Automatic machine translation services are the most commonly tools used to directly project information from one language into another. However, since term distribution across languages may be different due to variations in linguistic terms and writing styles, cross-lingual methods cannot reach the performance of monolingual methods. In this paper, a novel learning model is proposed based on the combination of uncertainty-based active learning and semi-supervised self-training approaches to incorporate unlabelled sentiment documents from the target language in order to improve the performance of cross-lingual methods. Further, in this model, the density measures of unlabelled examples are considered in active learning part in order to avoid outlier selection. The empirical evaluation on book review datasets in three different languages shows that the proposed model can significantly improve the performance of cross-lingual sentiment classification in comparison with other existing and baseline methods. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Posts collected from 7 forums between January 1, 2008 and September 30, 2013 were evaluated before and after the introduction of reformulated OxyContin on August 9, 2010. A quantitative evaluation of discussion levels across the study period and a qualitative coding of post content for OxyContin and 2 comparators for the 26 month period before and after OxyContin reformulation were conducted. Product endorsement was estimated for each product before and after reformulation as the ratio of endorsing-to-discouraging posts (ERo). Post-to-preintroduction period changes in ERos (ie, ratio of ERos) for each product were also calculated. Additionally, post content related to recipes for defeating reformulated OxyContin were evaluated from August 9, 2010 through September 2013. Results: Over the study period, 45, 936 posts related to OxyContin, 18, 685 to Vicodin (hydrocodone), and 23, 863 to Dilaudid (hydromorphone) were identified. The proportion of OxyContin-related posts fluctuated between 6.35 and 8.25 posts per 1000 posts before the reformulation, increased to 10.76 in Q3 2010 when reformulated OxyContin was introduced, and decreased from 9.14 in Q4 2010 to 3.46 in Q3 2013 in the period following the reformulation. The sentiment profile for OxyContin changed following reformulation; the post-to-preintroduction change in the ERo indicated reformulated OxyContin was discouraged significantly more than the original formulation (ratio of ERos=0.43, P<.001). A total of 37 recipes for circumventing the abuse-deterrent characteristics of reformulated OxyContin were observed; 32 were deemed feasible (ie, able to abuse). The frequency of posts reporting abuse of reformulated OxyContin via these recipes was low and decreased over time. Among the 5677 posts mentioning reformulated OxyContin, 825 posts discussed recipes and 498 reported abuse of reformulated OxyContin by such recipes (41 reported injecting and 128 reported snorting). Conclusions: After introduction of physicochemical properties to deter abuse, changes in discussion of OxyContin on forums occurred reflected by a reduction in discussion levels and endorsing content. Despite discussion of recipes, there is a relatively small proportion of reported abuse of reformulated OxyContin via recipes, particularly by injecting or snorting routes. Analysis of Internet discussion is a valuable tool for monitoring the impact of abuse-deterrent formulations.",Drug abuse; Epidemiology; Internet; Opioid analgesic; OxyContin; Prescription drug; Qualitative research; Social media; Surveillance,"acetaminophen, hydrocodone drug combination; drug combination; hydrocodone; hydromorphone; narcotic analgesic agent; oxycodone; paracetamol; chemistry; drug combination; human; Internet; medicinal chemistry; Opioid-Related Disorders; social media; Acetaminophen; Analgesics, Opioid; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Drug Combinations; Humans; Hydrocodone; Hydromorphone; Internet; Opioid-Related Disorders; Oxycodone; Social Media",2-s2.0-84902243141

This paper introduces Crowd Explicit Sentiment Analysis (CESA) as an approach for sentiment analysis in social media environments. Similar to Explicit Semantic Analysis, microblog posts are indexed by a predefined collection of documents. In CESA, these documents are built up from common emotional expressions in social streams. In this way, texts are projected to feelings or emotions. This process is performed within a Latent Semantic Analysis. A few simple regular expressions (e.g. ""I feel X"", considering X a term representing an emotion or feeling) are used to scratch the enormous flow of micro-blog posts to generate a textual representation of an emotional state with clear polarity value (e.g. angry, happy, sad, confident, etc.). In this way, new posts can be indexed by these feelings according to the distance to their textual representation. The approach is suitable in many scenarios dealing with social media publications and can be implemented in other languages with little effort. In particular, we have evaluated the system on Polarity Classification with both English and Spanish data sets. The results show that CESA is a valid solution for sentiment analysis and that similar approaches for model building from the continuous flow of posts could be exploited in other scenarios. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This may provide information for understanding the quality of healthcare providers and improving services. Objective: To examine whether tweets sent to hospitals in the English National Health Service contain information about quality of care. To compare sentiment on Twitter about hospitals with established survey measures of patient experience and standardised mortality rates. Design: A mixed methods study including a quantitative analysis of all 198 499 tweets sent to English hospitals over a year and a qualitative directed content analysis of 1000 random tweets. Twitter sentiment and conventional quality metrics were compared using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Key results: 11% of tweets to hospitals contained information about care quality, with the most frequent topic being patient experience (8%). Comments on effectiveness or safety of care were present, but less common (3%). 77% of tweets about care quality were positive in tone. Other topics mentioned in tweets included messages of support to patients, fundraising activity, self-promotion and dissemination of health information. No associations were observed between Twitter sentiment and conventional quality metrics. Conclusions: Only a small proportion of tweets directed at hospitals discuss quality of care and there was no clear relationship between Twitter sentiment and other measures of quality, potentially limiting Twitter as a medium for quality monitoring. However, tweets did contain information useful to target quality improvement activity. Recent enthusiasm by policy makers to use social media as a quality monitoring and improvement tool needs to be carefully considered and subjected to formal evaluation.",,Article; content analysis; controlled study; health care personnel; health care quality; health service; hospital; human; medical information; mortality; patient safety; patient satisfaction; personal experience; prospective study; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; social media; trust; United Kingdom; England; female; health services research; male; patient satisfaction; standards; England; Female; Health Services Research; Hospitals; Humans; Male; Patient Satisfaction; Prospective Studies; Quality of Health Care; Social Media,2-s2.0-84907152536

However, its application in promoting health behaviors is understudied. In order to provide insights into designing health marketing interventions to promote physical activity on Twitter, this exploratory infodemiology study applied both social cognitive theory and the path model of online word of mouth to examine the distribution of different electronic word of mouth (eWOM) characteristics among personal tweets about physical activity in the United States. This study used 113 keywords to retrieve 1 million public tweets about physical activity in the United States posted between January 1 and March 31, 2011. A total of 30,000 tweets were randomly selected and sorted based on numbers generated by a random number generator. Two coders scanned the first 16,100 tweets and yielded 4672 (29.02%) tweets that they both agreed to be about physical activity and were from personal accounts. Finally, 1500 tweets were randomly selected from the 4672 tweets (32.11%) for further coding. After intercoder reliability scores reached satisfactory levels in the pilot coding (100 tweets separate from the final 1500 tweets), 2 coders coded 750 tweets each. Descriptive analyses, Mann-Whitney U tests, and Fisher exact tests were performed. Tweets about physical activity were dominated by neutral sentiments (1270/1500, 84.67%). Providing opinions or information regarding physical activity (1464/1500, 97.60%) and chatting about physical activity (1354/1500, 90.27%) were found to be popular on Twitter. Approximately 60% (905/1500, 60.33%) of the tweets demonstrated users' past or current participation in physical activity or intentions to participate in physical activity. However, social support about physical activity was provided in less than 10% of the tweets (135/1500, 9.00%). Users with fewer people following their tweets (followers) (P=.02) and with fewer accounts that they followed (followings) (P=.04) were more likely to talk positively about physical activity on Twitter. People with more followers were more likely to post neutral tweets about physical activity (P=.04). People with more followings were more likely to forward tweets (P=.04). People with larger differences between number of followers and followings were more likely to mention companionship support for physical activity on Twitter (P=.04). Future health marketing interventions promoting physical activity should segment Twitter users based on their number of followers, followings, and gaps between the number of followers and followings. The innovative application of both marketing and public health theory to examine tweets about physical activity could be extended to other infodemiology or infoveillance studies on other health behaviors (eg, vaccinations).",,article; health behavior; human; Internet; motor activity; social marketing; Twitter messaging; United States; motor activity; social marketing; Twitter messaging; Health Behavior; Humans; Internet; Motor Activity; United States,2-s2.0-84902300657

Therefore, we first chose four types of feature sets and selected principle features by combining information gain and support vector machine techniques. Next, we compared the four types of features to determine which type of feature contributed more than others. Here we used three classification techniques: decision tree, support vector machines and naive Bayes. Finally, we used Karhunen-Loéve transform technique and average precision between positive and negative features to measure sentiment similarity. Experiment evaluations demonstrated that this new method is efficient and performs better than original average distance for Chinese micro-blogs. © 2013 The Author(s).",Chinese micro-blogs; feature selection; Karhunen-Loéve transform; sentiment similarity,Average Distance; Chinese micro-blogs; Classification technique; Feature sets; Information gain; Sentiment analysis; sentiment similarity; Support vector machine techniques; Data mining; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Support vector machines; Blogs,2-s2.0-84880665637

Sentiment analysis focuses on the analysis and understanding of the emotions from the text patterns. It identifies the opinion or attitude that a person has towards a topic or an object and it seeks to identify the viewpoint underlying a text span. Sentiment analysis is useful in social media monitoring to automatically characterize the overall feeling or mood of consumers as reflected in social media toward a specific brand or company and determine whether they are viewed positively or negatively on the web. This new form of analysis has been widely adopted in customer relation management especially in the context of complaint management. For automating the task of classifying a single topic textual review, document-level sentiment classification is used for expressing a positive or negative sentiment. So analyzing sentiment using Multi-theme document is very difficult and the accuracy in the classification is less. The document level classification approximately classifies the sentiment using Bag of words in Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

Negative opinions about a product can have a high impact in its sales figures. As a consequence, companies are more and more concerned about how to integrate opinion data in their business intelligence models so that they can predict sales figures or define new strategic goals. After analysing the requirements of this new application, this paper proposes a multidimensional data model to integrate sentiment data extracted from opinion posts in a traditional corporate data warehouse. Then, a new sentiment data extraction method that applies semantic annotation as a means to facilitate the integration of both types of data is presented. In this method, Wikipedia is used as the main knowledge resource, together with some well-known lexicons of opinion words and other corporate data and metadata stores describing the company products like, for example, technical specifications and user manuals. The resulting information system allows users to perform new analysis tasks by using the traditional OLAP-based data warehouse operators.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a new method to collectively label similar tweets. The underlying idea is to exploit similar tweets to make up for the lack of information in a tweet. Specifically, similar tweets are first grouped together by clustering. Then for each cluster a two-stage labeling is conducted: One labeler conducts SRL to get statistical information, such as the predicate/argument/role triples that occur frequently, from its highly confidently labeled results; then in the second stage, another labeler performs SRL with such statistical information to refine the results.

In Study 1, 94 highly productive school psychology scholars were identified from past research, and 51 (39 men, 12 women) submitted individual, short-answer responses to a 5-item questionnaire regarding their research strategies. A constant comparative approach was employed to sort and code individual sentiments (N=479) into categories. Seven broad categories of counsel for increasing productivity emerged: (a) research and publication practices and strategies, (b) collaboration, mentoring and building relationships, (c) navigating the peer-review process, (d) strategies to bolster writing productivity and excellence, (e) personal character traits that foster productivity, (f) preparation before entering the professoriate, and (g) other noteworthy sentiments. Results are discussed in terms of nine recommendations for scholars and graduate students who wish to increase their productivity. In Study 2, five of the most productive scholars (1 woman, 4 men) participated in a semi-structured interview about their high levels of productivity. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed, and a case analysis approach employed to profile each scholar. Study limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed. © 2011.",Contributions to literature; Productive scholars; Qualitative research; Survey research; Ways to increase scholarly productivity,"article; female; human; interpersonal communication; male; productivity; psychology; questionnaire; research; teacher; Communication; Efficiency; Female; Humans; Male; Mentors; Psychology, Educational; Questionnaires; Research; Research Report",2-s2.0-84856228615

Design/methodology/approach - Quantitative analysis of blog features, together with manual sentiment and agreement analysis and community identification, were performed on blog postings and their content. Correlation studies of the selected influential variables were conducted to determine the effectiveness of each variable. Findings - Agreement expressed by the linking blogger with the linked blogger, similar sentiments expressed by both bloggers on common topics, and community identity are statistically significant features for detecting influence in the linked blogs. Research limitations/implications - A small data set of 196 blog posting pairs was used for the study as the blog features and content are analysed manually. Nonetheless statistical analysis on the data set identified significant features that could be used in future studies to automate the influence detection process. Practical implications - Knowing the effects of blog features and content analysis in detecting influence among blog posts allows a better influence detection method to determine the main chain of information propagation within the blogosphere and the identities of influential bloggers. Originality/value - The approach of using blog features, content analysis, and community identity provides a comprehensive evaluation of influence in the blogosphere.

These studies have been important in their critical analyses of geopolitical relations by exposing how fear has been driving unjust policies and violent initiatives. However, I suggest that these lines of inquiries often neglect the localized playing out of fears, particularly how such sentiments can potentially stimulate actions and affect the practices and progress of politics at different geographical scales.This paper addresses the aforementioned lacuna by scrutinizing how fear is bounded up with the geographical extension of the US-led 'war on terror' to the Philippines in the post 9/11 era. I argue that the framings of terrorism in the country have allowed the government to manipulate fear to justify destructive strategies for the eradication of imminent 'threats'. However such initiatives are not only counterproductive to rooting out the sources of terror but also aid in the (re)production of violence. Not assuming the inevitability of such elegaic outcomes, I showcase the efforts of the Philippines communist 'rebel' group, Rebulusyonaryong Partido ng Manggagawa ng Mindanao (RPM-M), in repudiating official terrorism discourse by emphasising instead issues of state-induced vulnerability and marginalization. This in turn allows fear to be transformed into other modalities of emotions that are central to the formation of coalitional resistances to the arbitrary effects of state violence and its vicissitudes.By illuminating the constitution of (non)violence through emotions, there is an inherent wish to disrupt the natural conjoining of fear, terror and violence dominating contemporary geopolitical imaginations. Crucially, the implications of emotions for the thinking and doing of nonviolence augments a concrete pathway for operationalising a radical praxis of peace and justice that explicitly eschews a resort to force. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",'War on Terror'; (Non)Violence; Emotions; Fear; Philippines; Precarity,foreign policy; geopolitics; marginalization; political theory; political violence; state role; terrorism; theoretical study; vulnerability; Philippines; Lacuna,2-s2.0-79958208173

The region today is viewed as a key centre in processes of capital accumulation and (re)production and it occupies an important position in regulating social life. Yet, little is known about the spatial representations held by people about the regions in which they live. This article aims to contribute to fill this gap, by exploring two interrelated issues: what people mean by region and how they relate their sentiment of regional identity to the regional administrative space to which they belong. The study relies on focus group discussions and individual interviews administered in four West European regions. The empirical research suggests that the region is constructed by people as a geographically ambiguous reference and that their sense of regional identity is not necessarily directed towards the region as an administrative space. This challenges the correspondence between function (governance) and identity theorized by the literature on the institutionalization of regions. © The Author(s) 2010.",Governance; Identity; Regions; Western Europe,administrative framework; capital flow; empirical analysis; government; identity construction; region; socioeconomic conditions; Western Europe,2-s2.0-77953834393

We also design a prototype system for product information submission for the sake of ad selection. We take into account the consumer attitudes and promote the competitors of those products with which the consumers are not satisfied.

This involves the legitimation of male power in new and creative ways, often by the strategic accommodation or negotiation of liberal, progressive or feminist discourses. This paper examines one particular “new sexism” device—irony. Irony is a versatile device in men's magazines which allows a speaker to articulate both anti-feminist sentiments as well as engage in discourses of femininity, whilst disclaiming responsibility for or ownership of both. This strategic use of irony in relation to the expression of sexist or homophobic views is a common device in the “new lad” magazines examined in this paper. Compounding the slipperiness of the ironic utterance is the acknowledgement that it may be read variously by different audiences. For this reason, my analysis attempts to move beyond the rather narrow textual focus normally favoured in language analysis, to consider the multiple, often contradictory responses produced by audiences. The paper examines firstly, the reading habits and dispositions of two groups of dedicated readers of men's magazines. Then the paper considers detailed responses to the texts under discussion and specifically the meaning of the ironic utterance. The lack of consensus elicited by such an exercise arguably problematises our initial reading of irony as a device of “new sexism”. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Audience response; Irony; Lad mags; Masculinity; Sexism,,2-s2.0-85006668561

The data were analyzed using methods including descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and the Pearson product-difference correlation. The major findings of this study were as follows: 1. Five cognitive factors in the F&B management professional competencies were identified: planning and management, F&B design, product and service, environmental protection and safety, organization and operation, and relevant knowledge. Seven skill factors were identified: efficiency management, transaction and personnel management, control competence, emergency management, executive competence, interpersonal communication, and international service. Three affective factors were identified: job commitment, self-sentiment, and macroview. 2. All factors, except relevant knowledge, which was perceived ""should possess,"" were ranked as ""essential"" by students; however, the students all considered themselves as not well prepared in all these competency factors as evidenced in their self-assessed level of these competencies, which were consistently ranked ""ordinary"" in the questionnaires. 3. Students' needs for the various F&B management professional competencies under survey are shown in the ""Relativity Need Coordinates Grid"" (RNCG). 4.

Recent literature has examined the value propositions of e-marketplaces and proposed conceptual frameworks for their analysis. In this research, we move beyond conceptual analysis by developing a game-theoretic model of return-on-investment (ROI)-driven e-marketplace participation growth. This model provides insights into expected e-marketplace growth and participation, and can be used to determine both the viability and expected long-run size of a given e-marketplace. Our results indicate that the pricing policy of the e-marketplace intermediary can affect the rate at which participation grows and, therefore, sentiment about its prospects. We focus on e-marketplaces that add value to buyers and sellers by increasing the efficiency of administrative tasks but also simultaneously add value to buyers and reduce value to sellers by lowering prices for goods purchased. Value to participants in these e-marketplaces is determined by the volume of transactions that can be conducted using the e-marketplace, resulting in a two-sided network effect - buyers reacting to sellers and sellers reacting to buyers. The game-theoretic model identifies an e-marketplace equilibrium at which participation growth is predicted to stop. © 2005 M.E.

Nationalist sentiments and traditional patterns of ethnic intolerance were almost immediately revitalized. The analysis presented here concerns nationalist orientation in several of these countries in the context of ideology and social origin, which form links among nationalist identification, ethnic intolerance, democratic and economic orientation, and social class position. In 1996, representative national surveys were carried out in Hungary, the Czech and Slovak republics, and Poland. The study was then extended to Austria, where, like in other Western democracies, nationalistic, xenophobic, and rightist-radical attitudes have emerged. Analyses of the attitude structures (structural equation models) showed that different types of nationalism have developed. In post-communist countries - with the exception of the Czech Republic - anticapitalist feelings are strongly correlated with nationalism and ethnic intolerance. Such attitudes are held by the lower classes, yet this form of antiliberalism is not directed against democracy. In Austria, a classical ""underclass authoritarianism"" exists but remains independent of economic ideology. This is typical of the ""new right"" in Europe: a ""modernized"" brand of fascism in which neoliberal ideology, instead of anti-capitalist resentments, is combined with traditional value patterns.",Democratic orientation; Ethnic intolerance; Fascism; Nationalism; Neoliberal capitalism; New right; Post-communist countries; Social class; Socialism,,2-s2.0-0038807640

It argues that we need to examine political as well as economic motivations to explain inequality, and it shows, using the case of Russian history, how political anxieties about the integrity of social groups and their governability has served to create inequality by disadvantaging those excluded. The theoretical approach taken is a dynamic and social one, taking up Dunn's observations on the continued salience of Hobbes in today's world and Kharkhordin's Foucauldian analysis of 20th-century Russian collectivism. Inequality, in this light, is seen as something that can be produced by political emotions and discursive practices, rather than as a fixed situation to be explained in terms of income disparities, unequal rights, or structures of exploitation. The intention is not to displace these other accounts but to supplement them by drawing attention to the ways in which a political impulse for the preservation of society constantly reviews the criteria of conformist unity and thus continually resets the boundaries for defining insiders against the outside. Variegated categories of the dispossessed are thereby created historically, and they form multiple sediments at the 'bottom' or the 'peripheries' of the wider polity. Among ordinary people, fear of being excluded, and ambivalent sentiments to those who have been expelled, give rise to volatile judgements about the legitimacy of inequality - especially when (as in the contemporary turmoil in Russia) certain of the previously dispossessed suddenly take their chance to grasp wealth.

A new dataset of over 10,000 tweets including a high variety of figurative language types, manually annotated with sentiment scores, has been released in the context of the task 11 of SemEval-2015. In this paper, we propose an analysis of the tweets in the dataset to investigate the open research issue of how separated figurative linguistic phenomena irony and sarcasm are, with a special focus on the role of features related to the multi-faceted affective information expressed in such texts. We considered for our analysis tweets tagged with #irony and #sarcasm, and also the tag #not, which has not been studied in depth before. A distribution and correlation analysis over a set of features, including a wide variety of psycholinguistic and emotional features, suggests arguments for the separation between irony and sarcasm. The outcome is a novel set of sentiment, structural and psycholinguistic features evaluated in binary classification experiments. We report about classification experiments carried out on a previously used corpus for #irony vs #sarcasm. We outperform in terms of F-measure the state-of-the-art results on this dataset.

Existing microblog sentiment classification methods judge the sentiment polarity mainly according to textual content. However, since microblog messages are very short and noisy, and their sentiment polarities are often ambiguous and context-dependent, the accuracy of microblog sentiment classification is usually unsatisfactory. Fortunately, microblog messages lie in social media and contain rich social contexts. The social context information often implies sentiment connections between microblog messages. For example, a microblogging user usually expresses the same sentiment when posting multiple messages towards the same topic. Motivated by these observations, in this paper we propose a structured microblog sentiment classification (SMSC) framework. Our framework can combine social context information with textual content information to improve microblog sentiment classification accuracy. Two kinds of social contexts are used in our framework, i.e., social connections between microblog messages brought by the same author and social connections brought by social relations between users. In our framework, social context information is formulated as the graph structure over the sentiments of microblog messages. The objective function of our framework is a tradeoff between the agreement with content-based sentiment predictions and the consistency with social contexts. An efficient optimization algorithm is introduced to solve our framework. Experimental results on two Twitter sentiment analysis benchmark datasets indicate that our method can outperform baseline methods consistently and significantly. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Microblog; Sentiment classification; Social context,Data mining; Network function virtualization; Optimization; Semantics; Social networking (online); Benchmark datasets; Micro-blog; Objective functions; Optimization algorithms; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Social connection; Social context; Classification (of information); algorithm; Article; Bayesian learning; blogging; classifier; CMCTLF method; conceptual framework; controlled study; information; information processing; intermethod comparison; label propagation; logistic regression analysis; microblogging; optimization algorithm; priority journal; social context information; social environment; structured microblog sentiment classification; supervised microblog sentiment classification; support vector machine; textual content information,2-s2.0-84973288723

In contrast to the traditional coarse-grained sentiment analysis tasks, such as document-level sentiment classification, we are interested in the fine-grained aspect-based sentiment analysis that aims to identify aspects that users comment on and these aspects' polarities. Aspect-based sentiment analysis relies heavily on syntactic features. However, the reviews that this task focuses on are natural and spontaneous, thus posing a challenge to syntactic parsers. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a framework of adding a sentiment sentence compression (Sent-Comp) step before performing the aspect-based sentiment analysis. Different from the previous sentence compression model for common news sentences, Sent-Comp seeks to remove the sentiment-unnecessary information for sentiment analysis, thereby compressing a complicated sentiment sentence into one that is shorter and easier to parse. We apply a discriminative conditional random field model, with certain special features, to automatically compress sentiment sentences. Using the Chinese corpora of four product domains, Sent-Comp significantly improves the performance of the aspect-based sentiment analysis. The features proposed for Sent-Comp, especially the potential semantic features, are useful for sentiment sentence compression. © 2014 IEEE.",Aspect-based sentiment analysis; potential semantic features; sentence compression; sentiment analysis,Data mining; Information retrieval systems; Semantics; Coarse-grained; Conditional random field; Semantic features; Sentence compression; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Syntactic features; Syntactic parsers; Syntactics,2-s2.0-84941344533

This paper proposes a two-layer model for latent customer needs elicitation through use case reasoning.

Fuzzy support vector machines (SVMs) are developed to build sentiment prediction models based on a list of affective lexicons.

To evaluate this information properly, assessing positive or negative clinical outcomes or judging the impact of a medical condition on patient's well being are essential. Although methods of sentiment analysis have been developed to address these tasks, they have not yet found broad application in the medical domain. Methods and material: In this work, we characterize the facets of sentiment in the medical sphere and identify potential use cases. Through a literature review, we summarize the state of the art in healthcare settings. To determine the linguistic peculiarities of sentiment in medical texts and to collect open research questions of sentiment analysis in medicine, we perform a quantitative assessment with respect to word usage and sentiment distribution of a dataset of clinical narratives and medical social media derived from six different sources. Results: Word usage in clinical narratives differs from that in medical social media: Nouns predominate. Even though adjectives are also frequently used, they mainly describe body locations. Between 12% and 15% of sentiment terms are determined in medical social media datasets when applying existing sentiment lexicons. In contrast, in clinical narratives only between 5% and 11% opinionated terms were identified. This proves the less subjective use of language in clinical narratives, requiring adaptations to existing methods for sentiment analysis. Conclusions: Medical sentiment concerns the patient's health status, medical conditions and treatment. Its analysis and extraction from texts has multiple applications, even for clinical narratives that remained so far unconsidered. Given the varying usage and meanings of terms, sentiment analysis from medical documents requires a domain-specific sentiment source and complementary context-dependent features to be able to correctly interpret the implicit sentiment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Clinical text mining; Health status analysis; Medical language processing; Sentiment analysis,Computational linguistics; Data mining; Health; Natural language processing systems; Patient treatment; Social networking (online); Text processing; Health status; Medical language processing; Methods and materials; Multiple applications; Objective information; Quantitative assessments; Sentiment analysis; Text mining; Diagnosis; analytic method; Article; Bayesian learning; clinical decision making; entropy; feedback system; health status; human; knowledge base; machine learning; medical ontology; medicine; priority journal; quality control; quality of life; quantitative analysis; sentiment analysis; social media; support vector machine; Unified Medical Language System; wellbeing; data mining; health status; medical informatics; natural language processing; procedures; Data Mining; Health Status; Medical Informatics; Natural Language Processing,2-s2.0-84930091628

In spite of this potential improvement, the cost of building a domain-specific sentiment lexicon hinders its wider and more practical applications. To compensate for this difficulty, we propose extracting a sentiment lexicon from a domain-specific corpus by annotating an intelligently selected subset of documents in the corpus. Specifically, the subset is selected by an active learner with initializations from diverse text analytics, i.e. latent Dirichlet allocation and our proposed lexicon coverage algorithm. This active learning produces a better domain-specific sentiment lexicon which results in a higher accuracy of the sentiment classification. Subsequently, we evaluate extracted sentiment lexicons by observing (1) the increased F1 measure in sentiment classifications and (2) the increased similarity to the sentiment lexicon with the full annotation. We expect that this contribution will enable more accurate sentiment classification by domain-specific sentiment lexicons with less sentiment tagging efforts. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Materials and Methods: Two social media platforms were analyzed for this study: Twitter (San Francisco, CA) and LinkedIn (Mountain View, CA). For Twitter, a third-party analysis service (Tweetreach) was used to quantitatively analyze all tweets with the hashtags #WCE2013 and #WCE13 during a 7-day period surrounding the WCE. Two reviewers independently classified tweet content using a predefined Twitter-specific classification system. Tweet sentiment was determined using sentiment analysis software (Semantria, Inc., Amherst, MA). Finally, the penetration of Twitter and LinkedIn within the WCE faculty was assessed by means of a manual search. Results: During the study period, 335 tweets had the hashtag #WCE2013 or #WCE13. Content originated from 68 users resulting in a mean of 47 tweets/day and 4.9 tweets/contributor. Conference-related tweets had a reach of 38,141 unique Twitter accounts and an online exposure of 188,629 impressions. Physicians generated the majority of the content (63%), of which 55.8% were not attending the meeting. More tweets were informative (56.7%) versus uninformative (43.3%), and 17.9% had links to an external web citation. The mean sentiment score was 0.13 (range-0.90 to 1.80); 13.1%, 57.0%, and 29.9% of tweets were negative, neutral, and positive in sentiment, respectively. Of 302 WCE meeting faculty, 150 (49.7%) had registered LinkedIn accounts while only 52 (17.2%) had Twitter accounts, and only 19.2% tweeted during the meeting. Conclusions: Despite a relatively low number of Twitter users, tweeting about the WCE meeting dramatically increased its online exposure with dissemination of content that was mostly informative including engagement with physicians not attending the conference. While half of faculty at WCE 2013 had LinkedIn accounts, their social media footprint in Twitter was limited. © 2015 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,classification; computer program; Conference Paper; endourology; exposure; human; online analysis; physician; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; social media; United States; university; organization; physician; social media; urology; utilization; Congresses as Topic; Humans; Physicians; Social Media; Urology,2-s2.0-84928944714

Therefore, this study proposes a weighted graph model that considers both the relations of multiple nodes and their similarities as weights to automatically determine the VA ratings of affective words.

The main goal of this study is to investigate the impact of both perceived and actual size of migrant populations on anti-immigrant sentiments. A representative survey of inhabitants of local communities in the Flemish region of Belgium shows a strong tendency to overestimate the presence of non-nationals. The survey allows us to conclude that respondents living in ethnically diverse communities do not have more negative attitudes towards immigrants. Individuals who perceive more immigrants to be present in their communities are more hostile even after controlling for reported contact with members of immigrant groups. We can therefore conclude that the perceived size of the immigrant group has a stronger impact on anti-immigrant sentiments than the actual presence of ethnic minority groups. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",anti-immigrant sentiments; Belgium; community; ethnic diversity; group conflict theory,ethnic minority; immigrant; multiculturalism; perception; psychology; Belgium,2-s2.0-84912011481

Higher disagreement among investors' opinions predicts significantly lower future stock market returns during high-sentiment periods, but it has no significant effect on future stock market returns during low-sentiment periods. Our findings imply that investor sentiment is related to several causes of short-sale impediments suggested in the previous literature on investor sentiment, and that the stock return predictability of disagreement is driven by investor sentiment. We demonstrate that investor sentiment has a significant impact on the stock market return predictability of disagreement through in-sample and out-of-sample analyses.

However, most of the traditional opinion mining methods are coarse-grained and cannot understand natural languages. Thus, aspect-based opinion mining and summarization are of great interest in academic and industrial research. In this paper, we study an approach to extract product and service aspect words, as well as sentiment words, automatically from reviews. An unsupervised dependency analysis-based approach is presented to extract Appraisal Expression Patterns (AEPs) from reviews, which represent the manner in which people express opinions regarding products or services and can be regarded as a condensed representation of the syntactic relationship between aspect and sentiment words. AEPs are high-level, domain-independent types of information, and have excellent domain adaptability. An AEP-based Latent Dirichlet Allocation (AEP-LDA) model is also proposed. This is a sentence-level, probabilistic generative model which assumes that all words in a sentence are drawn from one topic - a generally true assumption, based on our observation. The model also assumes that every review corpus is composed of several mutually corresponding aspect and sentiment topics, as well as a background word topic. The AEP information is incorporated into the AEP-LDA model for mining aspect and sentiment words simultaneously. The experimental results on reviews of restaurants, hotels, MP3 players, and cameras show that the AEP-LDA model outperforms other approaches in identifying aspect and sentiment words. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Modern mass media make extensive use of images to persuade people to make commercial and political decisions. These effects and techniques are widely studied in the social sciences, but behavioral studies do not scale to massive datasets. Computer vision has made great strides in building syntactical representations of images, such as detection and identification of objects. However, the pervasive use of images for communicative purposes has been largely ignored. We extend the significant advances in syntactic analysis in computer vision to the higher-level challenge of understanding the underlying communicative intent implied in images. We begin by identifying nine dimensions of persuasive intent latent in images of politicians, such as 'socially dominant, ' 'energetic, ' and 'trustworthy, ' and propose a hierarchical model that builds on the layer of syntactical attributes, such as 'smile' and 'waving hand, ' to predict the intents presented in the images. To facilitate progress, we introduce a new dataset of 1, 124 images of politicians labeled with ground-truth intents in the form of rankings. This study demonstrates that a systematic focus on visual persuasion opens up the field of computer vision to a new class of investigations around mediated images, intersecting with media analysis, psychology, and political communication. © 2014 IEEE.",Communicative Intents; Human Attributes; Media Application; Visual Persuasion; Visual Sentiment Analysis,Behavioral research; Hierarchical systems; Pattern recognition; Syntactics; Communicative intent; Human attributes; Media application; Sentiment analysis; Visual Persuasion; Computer vision,2-s2.0-84911364912

Non-personal accounts, spam users and junk tweets, however, pose severe problems to the extraction of meaningful information and the validation of any research findings on tweets or twitter users. Therefore, the detection of such users is a critical and fundamental step for twitter-related geographic research. In this study, we develop a methodological framework to: (1) extract user characteristics based on geographic, graph-based and content-based features of tweets; (2) construct a training dataset by manually inspecting and labeling a large sample of twitter users; and (3) derive reliable rules and knowledge for detecting non-personal users with supervised classification methods. The extracted geographic characteristics of a user include maximum speed, mean speed, the number of different counties that the user has been to, and others. Content-based characteristics for a user include the number of tweets per month, the percentage of tweets with URLs or Hashtags, and the percentage of tweets with emotions, detected with sentiment analysis. The extracted rules are theoretically interesting and practically useful. Specifically, the results show that geographic features, such as the average speed and frequency of county changes, can serve as important indicators of non-personal users. For non-spatial characteristics, the percentage of tweets with a high human factor index, the percentage of tweets with URLs, and the percentage of tweets with mentioned/replied users are the top three features in detecting non-personal users. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,classification; detection method; geographical research; graphical method; Internet; mobile communication; network analysis; research work; social network,2-s2.0-84902269350

An anti-Greek sentiment evolved and spread among German citizens and solidarity for crisis-hit Greece was mostly rejected. Public surveys revealed that many Germans even wanted Greece to exit the Eurozone immediately. This article highlights the crucial role of the media in shaping the negative public opinion. In 2010, a period which has lately been referred to as Greek bashing, the German press had discussed the Greek financial crisis heatedly and controversially. Europe's largest daily newspaper, BILD, published numerous reports that implicitly and explicitly constituted the myth of the corrupt and lazy Greeks in comparison to the hard-working Germans. In 2012, the crisis had spread much further, and not only Greece but other countries too were suffering from high debt, economic stagnation and unemployment. The news coverage became more moderate and conciliating and presented the dramatic social consequences for the respective population. This study highlights not only the development of the German media's tenor on the Greek crisis through time, but adds an international perspective and widens the view by comparing the media treatment of the different countries involved. Based on 122 online articles, the study methodologically focuses on the analysis of metaphorical language in the news coverage of three comparable international news magazines: SPIEGEL (Germany), The Economist (the UK) and TIME (the USA), and contrasts the representation of Greece with the depiction of larger indebted European countries like Spain and Italy. The analysis shows remarkable differences in the evaluation and presentation of the crisis, which can be linked to the degree of involvement of Germany, the UK and the USA in European policies. © The Author(s) 2014.",Critical discourse analysis; discourse positions; German/English press; Greek/European financial crisis; media coverage; metaphor analysis,,2-s2.0-84903897234

Design/methodology/approach: The authors employed the approach of sentiment analysis as part of the netnography study. The authors processed 67,953 publicly shared tweets to identify customer sentiments about services of four airline companies. Sentiment analysis was conducted using the lexicon approach and vector-space model for assessing the polarity of Twitter posts. Findings: By analyzing Twitter posts for their sentiment polarity the authors were able to identify areas of customer service that caused customer satisfaction, dissatisfaction as well as delight. Positive sentiments were linked mostly to online and mobile check-in services, favorable prices, and flight experiences. Negative sentiments revealed problems with usability of companies' web sites, flight delays and lost luggage.

In Europe, this is partly due to a series of regulatory mishaps, ranging from mad cow disease in the United Kingdom to contamination of the blood supply in France. In the United States, general public confidence in the American government has been gradually declining for more than three decades, driven by a mix of cultural and political conflicts like negative political advertising, a corrosive news media, and cuts in regulatory budgets. While the former approach is based on an objective assessment of the risk, the latter is driven more by the perception of the risk, consumer sentiment, political will, and sectoral advocacy. In this article, the author examines three U.S.-based food case studies (acrylamide, bisphenol A, and artificial food colorings) where regulations at the local and state levels are increasingly being based on perceived risk advocacy rather than on the most effective response to the risk, be it to food safety or public health, as defined by regulatory interpretation of existing data. In the final section, the author puts forward a series of recommendations for how U.S.-based regulators can best handle those situations where the perceived risk is markedly different from the fact-based risk, such as strengthening the communication departments of food regulatory agencies, training officials in risk communication, and working more proactively with neutral third-party experts. © 2011 Society for Risk Analysis.",Acrylamide; Bisphenol A; Food colors; Public distrust; Risk communication,"Acrylamides; Bisphenol A; Food colors; Public distrust; Risk communication; Amides; Chemical contamination; Communication; Digital storage; Personnel training; Public risks; Risk perception; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; acrylamide; benzhydryl derivative; food dye; phenol derivative; data processing; food policy; food safety; regulatory approach; risk assessment; risk perception; state role; article; Europe; food contamination; interpersonal communication; legal aspect; public relations; risk assessment; trust; United States; Acrylamide; Benzhydryl Compounds; Communication; Europe; Food Coloring Agents; Food Contamination; Phenols; Public Relations; Risk Assessment; Trust; United States; United States",2-s2.0-84873133825

As social media becomes a more and more prevalent way of receiving political information, it becomes important to understand more completely the interaction between information, emotion, social community, and information-sharing behavior. In this paper, we describe a high-precision classifier for politically-oriented tweets, and an accurate classifier of a Twitter user's political affiliation. Coupled with existing sentiment-analysis tools for microblogs, these methods enable us to systematically study the interaction of emotion and sharing in a large corpus of politically-oriented microblog messages, collected from just before the 2012 US presidential election. In particular, we seek to understand how information sharing is influenced by the political affiliation of the sender and receiver of a message, and the sentiment associated with the message.

This paper presents the study we have carried out to address the problem of unbalanced data sets in supervised sentiment classification in a multi-lingual context. We propose three different methods to under-sample the majority class documents. These methods are Remove Similar, Remove Farthest and Remove by Clustering. Our goal is to compare the effectiveness of the proposed methods with the common random under-sampling. We also aim to evaluate the behavior of the classifiers toward different under-sampling rates. We use three different common classifiers, namely Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines and k-Nearest Neighbors. The experiments are carried out on two Arabic data sets and an English data set. We show that the four under-sampling methods are typically competitive. Naïve Bayes is shown as insensitive to unbalanced data sets. But Support Vector Machines seems to be highly sensitive to unbalanced data sets; k-Nearest Neighbors shows a slight sensitivity to imbalance in comparison with Support Vector Machines. © 2012 IEEE.",Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Opinion Mining; Sentiment Analysis; Text Classification; Unbalanced Data sets,NAtural language processing; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Text classification; Unbalanced data; Classification (of information); Cybernetics; Data mining; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Support vector machines; Text processing,2-s2.0-84872383401

This helps us understand when and why cooperation will arise, and applied research shows how these pressures can be harnessed to promote various types of cooperation. In particular, recent evidence shows how opportunities to acquire a good reputation can promote cooperation in laboratory and applied settings. Cooperation can be promoted by tapping into forces like indirect reciprocity, costly signaling, and competitive altruism. When individuals help others, they receive reputational benefits (or avoid reputational costs), and this gives people an incentive to help. Such findings can be applied to promote many kinds of helping and cooperation, including charitable donations, tax compliance, sustainable and pro-environmental behaviors, risky heroism, and more. Despite the potential advantages of using reputation to promote positive behaviors, there are several risks and limits. Under some circumstances, opportunities for reputation will be ineffective or promote harmful behaviors. By better understanding the dynamics of reputation and the circumstances under which cooperation can evolve, we can better design social systems to increase the rate of cooperation and reduce conflict.",Altruism; Applied game theory; Cooperation; Costly signaling; Helping; Reciprocity,"altruism; animal; article; child; cooperation; cost benefit analysis; empathy; evolution; fish; game; human; punishment; reward; shame; social psychology; Altruism; Animals; Biological Evolution; Child; Cooperative Behavior; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Empathy; Fishes; Game Theory; Helping Behavior; Humans; Psychology, Social; Punishment; Reward; Shame; Social Values",2-s2.0-84872366983

To improve participation, real-time surveys must be radically short. The shortest possible survey is a comment card. Patients′ comments can be found online at sites organized for rating clinical care, within e-mails, in hospital complaint registries, or through simplified satisfaction surveys such as ""Minute Survey."" Sentiment analysis uses patterns among words to classify a comment into a complaint, or praise. It further classifies complaints into specific reasons for dissatisfaction, similar to broad categories found in longer surveys such as Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems. In this manner, sentiment analysis allows one to re-create responses to longer satisfaction surveys from a list of comments. To demonstrate, this article provides an analysis of sentiments expressed in 995 online comments made at the RateMDs.com Web site. We focused on pediatrician and obstetrician/gynecologist physicians in District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia. We were able to classify patients′ reasons for dissatisfaction and the analysis provided information on how practices can improve their care. This article reports the accuracy of classifications of comments. Accuracy will improve as the number of comments received increases. In addition, we ranked physicians using the concept of time-to-next complaint. A time-between control chart was used to assess whether time-to-next complaint exceeded historical patterns and therefore suggested a departure from norms. These findings suggest that (1) patients′ comments are easily available, (2) sentiment analysis can classify these comments into complaints/praise, and (3) time-to-next complaint can turn these classifications into numerical benchmarks that can trace impact of improvements over time. The procedures described in the article show that real-time satisfaction surveys are possible. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",satisfaction surveys; sentiment analysis; text categorization; time-between complaints,article; artificial intelligence; attitude; feasibility study; gynecology; health care quality; health care survey; human; methodology; obstetrics; patient satisfaction; pediatrics; questionnaire; time; United States; Artificial Intelligence; Attitude; District of Columbia; Feasibility Studies; Gynecology; Health Care Surveys; Humans; Maryland; Obstetrics; Patient Satisfaction; Pediatrics; Quality of Health Care; Questionnaires; Research Design; Time Factors; Virginia,2-s2.0-84855396252

In essence, it creates a graph whose nodes correspond to the character n-grams of a document, while its weighted edges denote the average distance between them. Multiple documents of the same polarity can be aggregated into a polarity class graph, which can be compared with individual documents in order to identify the category of their sentiment. To evaluate our approach, we conducted large scale experiments on a real-world data set stemming from a snapshot of Twitter activity.

This paper proposes a random walk algorithm to construct domain-oriented sentiment lexicon by simultaneously utilizing sentiment words and documents from both old domain and target domain (or ""new domain""). The approach simulates a random walk on the graphs that reflect four kinds of relationships (the relationship between words, the relationship from words to documents, the relationship between documents, the relationship from documents to words) between documents and words.

He contends that the ideological ambiguity of both phenomena enabled the similarities between early minstrelsy and abolitionism in their depictions of African Americans, as well as their appropriations of each other's rhetoric, imagery, sentiment, and characterization. Because the antislavery movement had stronger support in Britain and an association with the middle classes, Nowatzki argues, its conflicts with blackface entertainment largely stemmed from British and American nationalism, class ideologies, and notions of ""highbrow"" and ""lowbrow"" culture. Nowatzki examines the ideological clashes between representations of African Americans in the antislavery movement and in blackface entertainment, revealing their common ground. For instance, white abolitionists encouraged former slaves to relate their experiences in an exaggerated slave dialect that maintained the appearance of intellectual inferiority popularized by minstrel shows. Minstrelsy conflated African American culture with theatrical appropriations of it by white performers, but, as Nowatzki contends, the assumption that white actors could perform ""authentic"" blackness also undercut beliefs in racial essentialism-the notion that racial groups possess distinctive essence. Combining cultural studies with literary analysis, Nowatzki considers this staging of African American identity through a variety of texts, including slave narratives, travelogues, minstrel song lyrics, stump speeches, and antislavery pamphlets, as well as the literary works of Dickens, Thackeray, and Carlyle on one side of the Atlantic, and Melville, Emerson, Sarah Margaret Fuller, and William Wells Brown on the other.

Most of existing approaches rely mainly on the template extraction to identify the explicit relatedness between product feature and opinion terms, which is insufficient to detect the implicit review features and mine the hidden sentiment association in reviews, which satisfies (1) the review features are not appear explicit in the review sentences; (2) it can be deduced by the opinion words in its context. From an information theoretic point of view, this paper proposed an iterative reinforcement framework based on the improved information bottleneck algorithm to address such problem. More specifically, the approach clusters product features and opinion words simultaneously and iteratively by fusing both their semantic information and co-occurrence information. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the template extraction based approaches. © 2009 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,Co-occurrence; In-depth study; Information bottleneck; Opinion mining; Product feature; Research communities; Semantic information; Sentiment analysis; Template extraction; Computational linguistics; Data mining; Information theory; Reinforcement,2-s2.0-84155165978

In his Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith attempts to explain why and how an individual or household will feel sympathy for other less well-off individuals or households. At the heart of Smith's analysis is the general proposition that sympathy (and presumably discernible actions based on that sympathy) is embodied in the ability of an individual to imagine, from his own perspective, the plight of the less well-off household. In this paper we posit a model of charitable giving that is predicated on this basic proposition that we believe lies at the center of explaining the pattern of charitable giving in the United States. In particular, we suggest that understanding the fundamental human and economic drivers of giving requires us to consider the nature and determinants of the ""warm glow"" a household experiences when making charitable donations to other households. We borrow from cognitive psychologists' research into how people judge reward distributions and infer causality of such distributions to explain when households are more and less likely to experience this warm glow. Specifically, we explain how biased perceptions of effort and luck, as the causes of reward distributions, will systematically reduce warm glow of high-income households, which may help explain the essentially flat relationship between income and percentage donations to charity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Identification manuals came to have the format we continue to use today when botanical instructors in post-Revolutionary France combined identification keys (step-wise analyses focusing on distinctions between plants) with the ""natural method"" (clustering of similar plants, allowing for identification by gestalt) and alphabetical indexes. Botanical works featuring multiple but linked techniques to enable plant identification became very popular in France by the first decade of the 19th century. British botanists, however, continued to use Linnaeus's sexual system almost exclusively for another two decades. Their reluctance to use other methods or systems of classification can be attributed to a culture suspicious of innovation, anti-French sentiment and the association of all things Linnaean with English national pride, fostered in particular by the President of the Linnean Society of London, Sir James Edward Smith. The British aversion to using multiple plant identification technologies in one text also helps explain why it took so long for English botanists to adopt the natural method, even after several Englishmen had tried to introduce it to their country. Historians of ornithology emphasize that the popularity of ornithological guides in the 19th and 20th centuries stems from their illustrations, illustrations made possible by printing technologies that improved illustration quality and reduced costs. Though illustrations are the most obvious features of late 19th century and 20th century guides, the organizational principles that make them functional as identification devices come from techniques developed in botanical works in the 18th century. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Candolle; Field guide; History of botany; Keys; Lamarck; Natural method,"article; book; botany; classification; history; human; plant; Botany; Classification; History, 18th Century; History, 19th Century; Humans; Manuals as Topic; Plants",2-s2.0-64149118304

To test our approach we conducted two experiments analyzing online forum discussions on the Internet movie database (IMDb) by examining the correlation of the social network structure with external metrics such as box office revenue and Oscar Awards. We find that discussion patterns on IMDb predict Academy Awards nominations and box office success. Two months before the Oscars were given we were able to correctly predict nine Oscar nominations.

The article examines how people use narratives to understand and to give meaning to their individual experiences in the context of broader socio-cultural, economic and political changes. Narrators' Oral life-histories and illness narratives reveal the ways in which the transition from Tanzania's unique form of socialism (Ujamaa) to Western-style neo-liberalism has led to the erosion of social cohesion at the community level, disrupted existing social support networks and limited access to healthcare. Participant observation and analysis of discursive data draw attention to the fact that the expression 'This is not our culture!' and its attendant sentiment 'Life is hard!' have become formulaic pronouncements, especially among poor and socially excluded people. These expressions indicate a loss of community values, and a decrease in respect and deference towards the elderly in the post-socialist era that is inextricably bound up with the hardships engendered by neo-liberal economic policies.",,cultural change; health care; identity construction; social exclusion; social network; Africa; Dar es Salaam [Tanzania]; East Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Tanzania,2-s2.0-54849442287

KHM simply adds to the traditional KH criterion the requirement that any good for which there is a willingness to pay or accept count as an economic good. This suggested expansion of KH, however, must confront objections to counting moral sentiments in general and non-paternalistic altruism in particular.

One explanation focuses on the analysis of the tension excitement generated by sporting encounters. Particular emphasis is placed on the work of Elias and Dunning, who suggest that in societies at a late stage in the “civilising process, ” affect-control is strongly established, so that people’s expressions of sentiment are strongly restrained. Excitement in such societies is thus to be found not so much in real-life situations as through mimetic or “imitative” excitement, which resembles that produced in critical situations in real life, but in a safe and pleasurable way. A second approach draws on a variety of theoretical perspectives, although the contributions derived from Emile Durkheim’s later work on the sociology of religion are prominent. The argument is advanced that sports encapsulate symbolically the social natures, relations, and identities of the collectivities that generate them. Sport, therefore, is perceived as a form of collective representation that may be invested with great social significance. Finally, relationships between the two approaches are considered. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,2-s2.0-0042791050

With the proliferation of videos posted online (e.g., on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter) for product reviews, movie reviews, political views, and more, affective computing research has increasingly evolved from conventional unimodal analysis to more complex forms of multimodal analysis. This is the primary motivation behind our first of its kind, comprehensive literature review of the diverse field of affective computing. Furthermore, existing literature surveys lack a detailed discussion of state of the art in multimodal affect analysis frameworks, which this review aims to address. Multimodality is defined by the presence of more than one modality or channel, e.g., visual, audio, text, gestures, and eye gage. In this paper, we focus mainly on the use of audio, visual and text information for multimodal affect analysis, since around 90% of the relevant literature appears to cover these three modalities. Following an overview of different techniques for unimodal affect analysis, we outline existing methods for fusing information from different modalities. As part of this review, we carry out an extensive study of different categories of state-of-the-art fusion techniques, followed by a critical analysis of potential performance improvements with multimodal analysis compared to unimodal analysis.

In this paper, we make use of the large volume of textual reviews for the automatic extraction of domain knowledge, namely, the explicit features/aspects in a specific product domain. We thus degrade the product-level modeling of user preferences, which suffers from the lack of data, to the feature-level modeling, which not only grants us the ability to predict user preferences through direct time series analy-sis, but also allows us to know the essence under the surface of product-level changes in purchasing patterns. Besides, the expanded feature space also helps to make cold-start recommendations for users with few purchasing records. Technically, we develop the Fourier-Assisted Auto-Regressive IntegratedMoving Average (FARIMA) process to tackle with the year-long seasonal period of purchasing data to achieve daily-Aware preference predictions, and we leverage the con-ditional opportunity models for daily-Aware personalized rec-ommendation. Extensive experimental results on real-world cosmetic purchasing data from a major e-commerce website (JD.com) in China verified both the effectiveness and effciency of our approach.",Collaborative Filtering; Recommender Systems; Sentiment Analysis; Time Series Analysis,Collaborative filtering; Electronic commerce; Harmonic analysis; Recommender systems; Sales; World Wide Web; Automatic extraction; Cold-start Recommendations; Content information; Content knowledge; E-commerce websites; Personalized recommendation; Personalized recommender systems; Sentiment analysis; Time series analysis,2-s2.0-84968879562

Objective: Our aim was to compare the number of messages expressed on Twitter and other social media during the measles outbreak with the number of online news articles and the number of reported measles cases to answer the question if and when social media reflect public opinion patterns versus disease patterns. Methods: We analyzed measles-related tweets, other social media messages, and online newspaper articles over a 7-month period (April 15 to November 11, 2013) with regard to topic and sentiment. Thematic analysis was used to structure and analyze the topics. Results: There was a stronger correlation between the weekly number of social media messages and the weekly number of online news articles (P<.001 for both tweets and other social media messages) than between the weekly number of social media messages and the weekly number of reported measles cases (P=.003 and P=.048 for tweets and other social media messages, respectively), especially after the summer break. All data sources showed 3 large peaks, possibly triggered by announcements about the measles outbreak by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment and statements made by well-known politicians. Most messages informed the public about the measles outbreak (ie, about the number of measles cases) (93/165, 56.4%) followed by messages about preventive measures taken to control the measles spread (47/132, 35.6%). The leading opinion expressed was frustration regarding people who do not vaccinate because of religious reasons (42/88, 48%). Conclusions: The monitoring of online (social) media might be useful for improving communication policies aiming to preserve vaccination acceptability among the general public. Data extracted from online (social) media provide insight into the opinions that are at a certain moment salient among the public, which enables public health institutes to respond immediately and appropriately to those public concerns. More research is required to develop an automatic coding system that captures content and user's characteristics that are most relevant to the diseases within the National Immunization Program and related public health events and can inform official responses.",Infectious disease outbreak; Internet; Measles; Netherlands; Vaccination; Web 2.0,adult; attitude to health; epidemic; human; measles; Netherlands; patient attitude; psychology; public health; public opinion; publication; social media; vaccination; Adult; Attitude to Health; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Measles; Netherlands; Newspapers as Topic; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Public Health; Public Opinion; Social Media; Vaccination,2-s2.0-84930332279

Our specific goals are to study factors related to a) numbers of retweets, b) time between the agency tweet and first retweet and c) time between the agency tweet and last retweet. Methods: We collect 164,104 tweets from 25 Federal Health Agencies and their 130 accounts. We use negative binomial hurdle regression models and Cox proportional hazards models to explore the influence of 26 factors on agency engagement. Account features include network centrality, tweet count, numbers of friends, followers, and favorites. Tweet features include age, the use of hashtags, user-mentions, URLs, sentiment measured using Sentistrength, and tweet content represented by fifteen semantic groups. Results: A third of the tweets (53,556) had zero retweets. Less than 1% (613) had more than 100 retweets (mean = 284). The hurdle analysis shows that hashtags, URLs and user-mentions are positively associated with retweets; sentiment has no association with retweets; and tweet count has a negative association with retweets. Almost all semantic groups, except for geographic areas, occupations and organizations, are positively associated with retweeting. The survival analyses indicate that engagement is positively associated with tweet age and the follower count. Conclusions: Some of the factors associated with higher levels of Twitter engagement cannot be changed by the agencies, but others can be modified (e.g., use of hashtags, URLs).

By propagating sentiment values from concepts with known values to empty concepts, we greatly enlarged our concept-level sentiment dictionary. In this work, we refine our previous method by adding relation selection and bias correction steps. Based on the assumption that concepts pass their sentiment values to their neighbors in different ways depending on the relations connecting them, we use sequential forward search to find the best combination of relations.

As social media applications are widely deployed in various platforms from personal computers to mobile devices, they are becoming a natural extension to human sensory system. The synthesis of social media with human intelligence has the potential to be the intelligent sensor network of unprecedented scale and capacity. However, it also poses several grand challenges to archive and retrieve information from massive social media data. One of these challenges is how to archive, retrieve and mine such massive unstructured data set efficiently to support real-time emergency response. To explore potential solutions, this paper utilizes parallel computing methods to harvest social media data sets, using Twitter as an example, and to store, index, query and analyse them. Within this framework, a Not Only SQL database (DB), MongoDB, is used to store data as document entries rather than relational tables. To retrieve information from the massive data sets efficiently, several strategies are used: (1) data are archived in the MongoDB across multiple collections with each collection containing a subset of the accumulated data, (2) parallel computing is applied to query and process data from each collection and (3) data are duplicated across multiple servers to support massive concurrent access of the data sets. This study has also tested the performance of spatiotemporal query, concurrent user requests and sentiment analysis over multiple DB servers, and performance benchmark results showed that the proposed approach could provide a solution for processing massive social media data with more than 40% performance improvement.

However, how users value information from these communities and how that affects their behavior and future expectations is not fully understood. Stock message boards provide an excellent setting to analyze these issues given the large user base and market uncertainty. Using data from 502 investor responses from a field experiment on one of the largest message board operators in South Korea, our analyses revealed that investors exhibit confirmation bias, whereby they preferentially treat messages that support their prior beliefs. This behavior is more pronounced for investors with higher perceived knowledge about the market and higher strength of belief (i.e., sentiment) toward a particular stock.

The need of such a formalism is motivated by the lack of standards for Opinion Mining (a.k.a. Sentiment Analysis) that obey to certain requirements of efficiency, ease of manual annotation, scalability, and, most of all, that aim at satisfying the real goal of Sentiment Analysis applications. Opinion Mining is an Information Retrieval task, so that its output should be designed for being usable and fruitful from the perspective of a search engine. Our contribution is twofold. First, we present a standard methodology for the annotation of affective statements in text that is strictly independent from any application domain. The second and orthogonal part of the approach regards instead the domain-specific adaptation that relies on the use of an ontology of support, that is domain-dependent by definition. We finally evaluate our proposal by means of fine-grained analyses of the disagreement between different annotators. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The product-oriented domain ontology is constructed automatically at first, then algorithms to identify FOP are designed by mapping product features and opinions to the conceptual space of the domain ontology, and finally comparative experiments are conducted to evaluate the model. Experimental results indicate that the performance of the proposed approach in this paper is efficient in obtaining a more accurate result compared to the state-of-art algorithms.

It involves predicting, for each natural language sentence, an abstract representation of the grammatical entities in the sentence and the relations between these entities. This representation provides an interface to compositional semantics and to the notions of ""who did what to whom."" The last two decades have seen great advances in parsing English, leading to major leaps also in the performance of applications that use parsers as part of their backbone, such as systems for information extraction, sentiment analysis, text summarization, and machine translation. Attempts to replicate the success of parsing English for other languages have often yielded unsatisfactory results. In particular, parsing languages with complexword structure and flexible word order has been shown to require non-trivial adaptation. This special issue reports on methods that successfully address the challenges involved in parsing a range of morphologically rich languages (MRLs). This introduction characterizes MRLs, describes the challenges in parsing MRLs, and outlines the contributions of the articles in the special issue.

In this paper, we present an approach to feature-level sentiment detection that integrates natural language processing with statistical techniques, in order to extract users’ opinions about specific features of products and services from user-generated reviews. First, we extract domain features, and each review is modelled as a lexical dependency graph. Second, for each review, we estimate the polarity relative to the features by leveraging the syntactic dependencies between the terms.

These messages are a rich source of information for companies for sentiment analysis or opinion mining. There is however a great obstacle for analyzing the messages directly: as the company names are often ambiguous (e.g. apple, the fruit vs. Apple Inc.), one needs first to identify, which messages are related to the company. In this paper we address this question. We present various techniques for classifying tweet messages containing a given keyword, whether they are related to a particular company with that name or not. We first present simple techniques, which make use of company profiles, which we created semi-automatically from external Web sources. Our advanced techniques take ambiguity estimations into account and also automatically extend the company profiles from the twitter stream itself.

However, most of the applications have already been developed in an ad hoc manner, mainly, due to the lack of adequate tools, yielding difficulties in customizing applications and requesting high time consuming for constructing and maintaining these applications. This work addresses these problems and proposes a software framework for building Web mining applications in the blog world. The architecture of the proposed framework combines the use of blog crawling and data mining algorithms, in order to provide a complete and flexible solution for building general-purpose Web mining applications. The framework flexibility allows some important customizations, such as the construction of adapters for reading text from different blogs, and the use of different pre-processing techniques and data mining algorithms. In order to improve the efficacy of information extraction from blogs, ontology is used in the blog's description. For this, there are software agents responsible for tracking and indexing blogs related to a specific tag and for mining blog datasets. Moreover, web services are used for encapsulating existing tools and maximize reuse. This framework has been instantiated in order to be applied for helping the blog users to effectively find out relevant information in the blog world. The focus of this paper is on describing the novel software architecture of the general framework (blog crawling and data mining) providing detailed information about the data mining sub-framework, which uses the semantic web services technology for automating service composition and consists on the main research contribution. A case study of an e-commerce application for analyzing the user's sentiment regarding specific products is reported and its results considers the effort reduction when creating a web mining application by using the proposed integrated frameworks and existing data mining tools, as well as a qualitative analysis related to quality aspects of the developed application, such as the evolution impact. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Measurements included participation in focus groups designed to explore perceptions of ICU care and clinical research. Audiotapes were transcribed and analyzed to identify common patterns and themes using grounded theory. Demographic and clinical data were summarized using standard statistical methods. Results: Seventy-four SDMs (corresponding to 24% of eligible patients) participated. Most SDMs were women and described long-term relationships with the patients represented. SDMs described their role as ""overwhelming,"" their emotions were accentuated by the fatigue of the ICU experience, and they relied on family members, social contacts, and religion as sources of support. Altruism was reported as a common motivation for potential study participation, a sentiment often strengthened by the critical illness episode. Although research was viewed as optional, some SDMs perceived invitation for research participation as tacit acknowledgment of therapeutic failure. SDMs expressed a preference for observational studies (perceived as low risk) over interventional designs (perceived as higher risk). Trust in the ICU team and the research enterprise seemed tightly linked. Conclusions: Despite significant emotional duress, SDMs expressed interest in investigation and described multiple factors motivating participation.

However, few of them take the strength of user sentiments into consideration, which is particularly important in measuring the overall quality of products/services. Intuitively, different reviews for the same feature should have quite different sentiment strength, even though they may express the same polarity of sentiment. This paper presents an approach to estimating the sentiment strength of user reviews according to the strength of adverbs and adjectives expressed by users in their opinion phrases.

Liscutin N.,Surfing the neo-nationalist wave: A case study of Manga Kenkanryū,2009,Cultural Studies and Cultural Industries in Northeast Asia: What a Difference a Region Makes,14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77952466879&partnerID=40&md5=de19ff4dc1fac8dca524fdbfb0fae744,"The year 2005 had been designated ""Korea-Japan Friendship Year"" by the Korean (ROK) and Japanese governments, to mark the fortieth anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic ties between the two countries. Various joint events and economic, sports, and cultural exchanges were meant to put a positive spin on ROK-Japan relations, which had grown rather tense in the nineties. By March 2005, however, as Shimane Prefecture's assembly passed the ""Takeshima Day"" bill,1 Korean protesters rallied around the Japanese Embassy in Seoul in response, and President Roh Moo Hyun declared that ""Japanese foreign policy has reached an intolerable point,""2 it became fairly obvious that the ""friendship year"" was not proceeding as planned. Anti-Japanese demonstrations, which were occasionally accompanied by violent and spectacular action, the boycott of Japanese goods, and concomitant strong political language, showed no signs of abating in South Korea until well into autumn. While Japanese politicians continued to add fuel to the raging flames of Korean ire, many of their citizens (and business people) felt strong unease in view of the anti-Japan protests in South Korea (and China) and the conflict-laden atmosphere. Once again, the past was haunting Japan-Korea relations and a great many words, actions, and media spectacles were employed on both sides, to foreground not what might bind the two countries but what seemed to divide them. At the same time, by contrast, Japanese fans seemed undeterred in their passion for Korean television soaps, K-pop and their stars: The ""Korean Wave""3 was clearly still booming. Likewise, Korean readers sent Japanese novels up the top of bestseller lists, surpassing the popularity of local authors by a remarkable margin.4 The coexistence of, for instance, anti-Japanese protests and enthusiasm for popular culture products made in Japan in South Korea or, conversely, of ""Korean Wave"" and anti-Korean sentiments in Japan may seem paradoxical. A paradox that one might be inclined to explain by a generation gap, in which younger generations in both Japan and South Korea actively participate and share in the transnational flows of popular culture products and the regionalizing or globalizing possibilities offered by new media, especially the Internet, and in which older generations might be seen as more concerned with the historical and political determinants (and problems) of Japan-Korea relations. With an eye to younger and future generations, this perspective highlights a reconciliatory power ascribed to cultural exchange and regional flows of culture and consumer products, flows that are facilitated by the deregulation of regional and global markets and the globalizing effects of new media technologies. Likewise, it emphasizes the concomitant positive aspects of hybridizing effects in, and for, cultural practices and the reception/ consumption of transnational cultural products. While there is sufficient evidence to support such a perspective,5 there is equally - And perhaps not so paradoxically - good reason to argue that those transnational flows and hybridization effects induce or enhance anxieties of losing the seeming certainties of a clearly demarcated national cultural identity and can, therefore, generate neo-nationalist backlashes precisely by way of the means and opportunities that the new global media and visual technologies afford. This chapter is a case study of one such neo-nationalist backlash expressed in popular culture and disseminated through new media. In July 2005, amid the furore - And informed by both the clashes and the cravings - A hitherto insignificant Tokyo publishing house launched Yamano Sharin's Manga Kenkanryu 6 (""Manga The Anti-Korean Wave"").7 As the title suggests, Kenkanryu is presented as an oppositional vision to an allegedly blind enthusiasm for things Korean among Japanese followers of the ""Korean Wave."" It seeks to counteract this infatuation by providing ""the truth"" about Korea, its history, culture, and Korean claims against Japan for restitution. Putting its premise - ""When you know [about] Korea, it's only natural that you become Anti-Korean!""8 - into action, Kenkanryu aims to educate its readers on a wide range of misdemeanours allegedly committed by Korea, which it describes as ""thoroughly depraved nation.""9 The manga seeks to demonstrate that ""anti-Japan"" sentiments and protests in Korea lack any legitimate historical basis, and that ""correct"" historical knowledge would enable Japanese people to be proud of their country's present and past achievements and thus fortified, to take a firm stance against any kind of ""Japan-bashing"" by their Asian neighbors. Wrapped in pedagogical camouflage, Kenkanryu ventures under the banner of ""truth"" into an ""identity war"" between Japan and Korea. As one 18-year old reader put it: ""If you read this [manga] and you don't get angry about Korea, you can't be Japanese . . .""10 Critics have either dismissed Kenkanryu as simply another, of several, neonationalist pop-culture products or denied it any attention at all, an understandable stance given that the manga makes for fairly unpleasant reading. To my knowledge, one of the first in-depth critical analyses of the manga and the corresponding blog hype was the 2007 article by Rumi Sakamoto and Matt Allen posted on Japan Focus.11 While my textual analysis of Kenkanryu pursues similar lines of criticism, I want to make a case for examining the educational power ascribed to the manga. In view of an emerging ""youthful""12 Japanese nationalism that appears to spread by means of visual technologies and new media, it seems crucial to gain a critical understanding of popular culture phenomena such as Kenkanryu and the ""cultures of circulation""13 within which they emerge. In particular, I am keen to understand the ways in which these new sites of pedagogy ""generate forms of knowledge"" that are ""mediated through specific social relations and mobilize select ideologies, histories and memories""14 in response to what is considered an ""identity war"" between Japan and Korea. Kenkanryu became an instant bestseller and topped the Amazon Japan ranking for several weeks. The second volume was published in February 2006, and the third in August 2007. Again, each of these publication dates coincided with significant political and historical dates.15 To date, the combined sales of the Kenkanryu volumes have reached a total of around 800,000 copies,16 which is a fairly impressive figure when compared to the sales figure for other manga in book format. The breathtaking impact of Manga Kenkanryu is demonstrated less, however, by its sales figures than by the extensive pro-Kenkanryu movements that rapidly spread on various Japanese and global Internet sites, such as the Japanese 2channel (ni-channeru) or the English-language blog site Occidentalism.org. Anti-Korea sentiments began to appear on Japanese blog sites from around 2002, in the wake of the Soccer World Cup and the North Korea abduction affair.17 But the manga seems to have accelerated dramatically the dissemination of Anti-Korea ideas and fuelled, in turn, the discussions on those Internet sites, with the effect that the ""Anti-Korean Wave"" quickly transformed into a spectacular mainstream trend. The rapid development of this phenomenon points to significant changes in the ways in which a text like Kenkanryu is circulated through new sites of knowledge production and dissemination that are created by the new media. From the start, Kenkanryu was designed to participate in these ""new sites of learning:""18 The manga draws explicitly on and promotes specific Internet sources and blog sites, and gestures implicitly towards the efficacy of these joint forces in enabling an ""Anti-Korean Wave."" To this end, and similar to its related Internet sites, the manga manipulates quite effectively existing distrust in the mass media and school education. It presents itself as a young, subversive educational force in opposition to those traditional sites of learning and knowledge transfer, and promises to provide information that those established institutions allegedly seek to suppress. Kenkanryu thus offers its readers the thrill of breaking taboos along the lines of ""what you always wanted to know about Korea but were afraid to ask!"" (Or rather, ""what you always thought about Korea but never dared to say!"") Arguably, part of the pleasure that Kenkanryu - And other revisionist narratives like it - Affords its readers, lies in it ""flaunting a feigned oppositionality.""19 © 2009 by Hong Kong University Press, HKU.

Technically speaking, we shall demonstrate that the taxation extolled by the legislator induces a certain crowding out effect as regards to responsibility. In the first part of this article we shall therefore insist that economic policies in terms of taxation drive away the sentiment of individual responsibility.

Historians dispute its definition, and many deem the term to be paradoxical. On the basis of an analysis of three Canadian educational commissions from 1950, 1968, and 1995, the author argues that progressive education is better understood as highlighting the dual nature of policy frames. Progressive language offers appealing abstract sentiments that are well suited to schools' organizational realities and are adaptable to shifting political and cultural climates. This flexibility illustrates a key property of framing: how actors create contingent meanings by adapting an inherent logic to changing social situations. This article shows how each commission invoked similar progressive ideals, but used those ideals to justify different, even opposed, reforms. It interprets progressivism as a loose but resonant language that is reused over time to express changing educational priorities in new cultural settings and to reconcile disparate interests.",,,2-s2.0-0036811858

While acknowledging Smith's views on the evolutive nature of the general rules of morality (as well as the individual's understanding of them), we take the general rules as given. Within the game's framework we show how self-command can be attained in equilibrium solely due to the 'internal reputation effect' arising from one's self-interested behavior. Our game-theoretic reinterpretation of TMS sheds new light on the acquisition of self-command and casts Smith as a sophisticated early theorist: he had already dealt with the issue of reputational enforcement, and wrestled with the same tension that has led to the eductive and evolutive approaches to non-cooperative game theory. © Sage Publications.",,,2-s2.0-21344435417

Recent surveys by pollsters and social scientists seem to document a ""backlash"" during the 1980s, with public sentiment shifting from sympathy to resentment. The U.S. Supreme Court, for example, recently upheld a controversial 1990 New York City law forbidding poor people from panhandling in the city's subways. This study was designed to develop a brief, reliable, valid scale to more precisely assess public attitudes toward homelessness (acronym PATH), which future researchers can use to more exactly chart changes and correlates of public opinion toward homelessness. Here, a cross section of 222 adults in New York City responded to a 38- item survey containing PATH and five other brief scales. Analysis of responses found general support for four initial hypotheses: (1) There was indeed a remarkable diversity of public opinion, from 3 to 20 points on the 0- 20- point PA TH Scale, ranging from profound sympathy to anger and disgust. (2) A short- form of MacDonald's Poverty Scale correlated only modestly with one's PATH score (r=+0.49) that, along with respondents' comments, suggests these two forms of social distress may now be viewed quite separately in the American psyche. (3) Psychometrically, the 5- item PATH proved to be high in internal reliability (α=0.74), and in construct validity, with significant correlations with 4 other items. (4) Results so far indicate at least some personality basis for PATH. As expected, those most sympathetic to the homeless were significantly lower in authoritarian personality (r=-0.24) and in belief in a just world (r=-0.13). Unexpectedly, PATH correlated negatively with Social Desirability (r=- 0.15, p < 0.05). Potential uses of this PATH scale are explored, along with the notion of important distinctions in poverty and homelessness as two increasingly separate forms of social distress. © 1992 Human Sciences Press, Inc.",homeless; New York City; public opinion; urban problems,,2-s2.0-0002118383

The following study of 563 students enrolled in a large Southern California university adds to the heterosexual student literature by operationalizing an important research variable, FRAIDS, and by embarking on explanatory analysis of attitude and self‐reported behavior. FRAIDS, which we will define as the fear of getting AIDS from casual contact sources, may be helpful in explaining both high‐risk sexual behavior among heterosexuals and pro‐quarantine sentiment. However, only the subsets of the FRAIDS variable (FRAIDS‐dry and FRAIDS‐wet) proved explanatory. FRAIDS‐dry (fear of HIV infection from dry sources) proved significant in explaining sexual activity, while FRAIDS‐wet (fear of HIV infection from wet casual contact sources) was found significant in explaining pro‐quarantine sentiment. The converse was not true. Using homophobia as a control variable, homophobia was found to overshadow FRAIDS‐wet for males but FRAIDS‐wet rivaled homophobia in predicting pro‐quarantine sentiment for females. Growing quarantine sentiment was noted among the students, as the survey took place during two different time periods (Fall of 1986 (N= 375) and Spring of 1988 (N= 188)), essentially before and after the actual vote in November 1986 on a pro‐quarantine initiative (Proposition 64) that appeared on the California ballot. This apparent increase in pro‐quarantine sentiment among students (and voters) highlights the need for attention to homophobia as well as detailed discussion of the fear of wet casual contact in AIDS education.

Since then, two opposing movements continue to shape how consumers view dietary nitrate and nitrite. The discovery of the profound physiological importance of nitric oxide led to the realization that dietary nitrate contributes significantly to the nitrogen reservoir for nitric oxide formation. Numerous clinical studies have also demonstrated beneficial effects from dietary nitrate consumption, especially in vascular and metabolic health.

We outline key challenges stemming from the complexity and subtlety of language use, the prevalence of creative and non-standard language, and the lack of paralinguistic information, such as tone and stress markers. We describe automatic systems and datasets commonly used in sentiment analysis. We summarize several manual and automatic approaches to creating valence- and emotion-association lexicons. We also discuss preliminary approaches for sentiment composition (how smaller units of text combine to express sentiment) and approaches for detecting sentiment in figurative and metaphoric language-these are the areas where we expect to see significant work in the near future. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Researchers have largely relied on textual sentiment analysis to develop systems to predict political elections, measure economic indicators, and so on. Recently, social media users are increasingly using additional images and videos to express their opinions and share their experiences. Sentiment analysis of such large-scale textual and visual content can help better extract user sentiments toward events or topics. Motivated by the needs to leverage large-scale social multimedia content for sentiment analysis, we propose a cross-modality consistent regression (CCR) model, which is able to utilize both the state-of-the-art visual and textual sentiment analysis techniques. We first fine-tune a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image sentiment analysis and train a paragraph vector model for textual sentiment analysis. On top of them, we train our multi-modality regression model. We use sentimental queries to obtain half a million training samples from Getty Images. We have conducted extensive experiments on both machine weakly labeled and manually labeled image tweets. The results show that the proposed model can achieve better performance than the state-of-theart textual and visual sentiment analysis algorithms alone. © 2016 ACM.",Cross-modality regression; Multimodality analysis; Sentiment analysis,Information retrieval; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Social networking (online); Websites; World Wide Web; Convolutional neural network; Cross modality; Economic indicators; Multi-modality; Multimedia contents; Regression model; Sentiment analysis; Social media analytics; Data mining,2-s2.0-84964318563

User reviews provide an effective channel to address this question. However, most existing review summarization tools treat reviews as bags-of-words (i.e., mixed review categories) and are limited to extract software aspects and user preferences. We present a novel review summarization framework, SUR-Miner. Instead of a bags-of-words assumption, it classifies reviews into five categories and extracts aspects for sentences which include aspect evaluation using a pattern-based parser. Then, SUR-Miner visualizes the summaries using two interactive diagrams. Our evaluation on seventeen popular apps shows that SUR-Miner summarizes more accurate and clearer aspects than state-of-the-art techniques, with an F1-score of 0.81, significantly greater than that of ReviewSpotlight (0.56) and Guzmans' method (0.55). Feedback from developers shows that 88% developers agreed with the usefulness of the summaries from SUR-Miner. © 2015 IEEE.",Data Mining; Review Summarization; Sentiment Analysis; User Feedback,Data mining; Miners; Natural language processing systems; Syntactics; F1 scores; Interactive diagrams; Sentiment analysis; Software developer; State-of-the-art techniques; User feedback; User reviews; Software engineering,2-s2.0-84963811308

Product images and associated descriptions are the two main sources of information used by the shoppers to gain knowledge about a product. However, these two pieces of information may not always present the true picture of the product. Images could be deceiving, and descriptions could be overwhelming or cryptic. Moreover, the relative rank of these products among the peers may lead to inconsistencies. Hence, a useful and widely used piece of information is “user reviews”. A number of vendors like Amazon have created whole ecosystems around user reviews, thereby boosting their revenues. However, extracting the relevant and useful information out of the plethora of reviews is not straight forward, and is a very tedious job. In this paper we propose a product ranking system that facilitates the online shopping experience by analyzing the reviews for sentiments, evaluating their usefulness, extracting and weighing different product features and aspects, ranking it among similar comparable products, and finally creating a unified rank for each product.

This application is of great use to researchers in the financial domain who study the impact of news (media) on the stock markets. We investigate the viability of a new fine-grained sentiment annotation scheme. Most of the current approaches to sentiment analysis focus on the detection of explicit sentiment. As news text often contains implicit sentiment, i.e. factual information implying positive or negative sentiment, our approach aims to identify both explicit and implicit sentiment. Furthermore, this sentiment is analyzed on a fine-grained level by detecting the topic of the sentiment, as sentiment is not always expressed towards the topics one is interested in. In order to test our approach, we assembled a corpus of company-specific news articles, which was manually labeled by four annotators to create a gold standard. We compare the results of our method to the performance of two coarse-grained baseline systems: a lexicon-based approach and a supervised machine learning approach that makes use of lexical features. Our fine-grained approach outperforms both baselines, and its output shows substantial to almost perfect agreement with the gold standard sentiment labels. Using our annotation scheme, we are able to filter out irrelevant sentiment expressions and detect explicit and implicit sentiment in a reliable way. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies have suggested that public emotions shown through Tweeter may well be correlated with the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, can public sentiment be analyzed to predict the movements of the stock price of a particular company? If so, is it possible for the stock price of one company to be more predictable than that of another company? Is there a particular kind of companies whose stock price are more predictable based on analyzing public sentiments as reflected in Twitter data? In this article, we propose a method to mine Twitter data for answers to these questions. Specifically, we propose to use a data mining algorithm to determine if the price of a selection of 30 companies listed in NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange can actually be predicted by the given 15 million records of tweets (i.e., Twitter messages). We do so by extracting ambiguous textual tweet data through NLP techniques to define public sentiment, then make use of a data mining technique to discover patterns between public sentiment and real stock price movements. With the proposed algorithm, we manage to discover that it is possible for the stock closing price of some companies to be predicted with an average accuracy as high as 76.12%.

Our model also provides a diagnostic for the duration of bubbles: applied to the period before the Oct. 1987 crash, there is clear evidence that the bubble started at least 4. years earlier. We confirm the validity and universality of the volatility-confined LPPL model on seven other major bubbles that have occurred in the World in the last two decades. Using Bayesian inference, we find a very strong statistical preference for our model compared with a standard benchmark, in contradiction with Chang and Feigenbaum (2006) which used a unit-root model for residuals. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Bayesian analysis; Finite-time singularity; Log-periodic power law; Mean reversal; Positive feedbacks; Rational bubbles; Stochastic discount factor; Super-exponential growth,,2-s2.0-84902137317

Memories of these events still circulate in present-day Vienna and provide an emotional reservoir for anti-Turkish sentiments. Current tendencies to fictionalise politics support the dissemination of such anti-Turkish narratives in rather unconventional and hybrid genres such as comic-style booklets. In this article, the authors investigate the interplay of collective memories and this hybrid genre within the social context of the fictionalisation of politics through the test case of the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ), one of the most successful European right-wing populist parties. By combining multimodal analysis with the discourse-historical approach in critical discourse analysis, they illustrate the ways in which visuals enable the conveying of contradictory meanings through a discursive strategy of calculated ambivalence by blurring past and present, fiction and reality. © The Author(s), 2014.",Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ); discourse-historical approach (DHA); fictionalisation of politics - politicisation of fiction; insinuations; multimodality; political comics; presuppositions; strategy of calculated ambivalence; Turkish migrants,,2-s2.0-84899456929

Although these methods are aimed at handling the complex characteristics of natural language, usually they do not consider microblogs as networked data. Early approaches for overcoming this limitation consist in exploiting friendship relationships, since connected users may be more likely to hold similar opinions (Homophily and Social Influence). However, the assumption about the friendship relations does not reflect the real world, where two connected users could have different opinions about the same topic. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a semi-supervised framework that estimates user polarities about a given topic by combining post contents and weighted approval relations, which are intended to better represent the contagion on social networks. The experimental investigation reveals that incorporating approval relations can lead to statistically significant improvements over the performance of complex supervised classifiers based only on textual features. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.",,Complex characteristics; Experimental investigations; Natural languages; Polarity classification; Sentiment analysis; Social influence; Supervised classifiers; Textual features; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Natural language processing systems,2-s2.0-84892712283

Still, the availability of big amounts of data coming from the World Wide Web makes easier the study of both new techniques and evaluation methods. Current literature mainly focuses on two approaches which rely on sentiment lexicons (i.e., lists of words associated to scores of sentiment polarity) or on Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP). In this paper, on one hand, we introduce and evaluate a novel algorithm for SA that relies on a simple set of propagation rules applied at syntactic level within a dependency parse tree. On the other hand, we propose a context-based model where the users' sentiments (or opinions) are tuned according to some context of analysis. Finally, we present the system called SentiVis which implements these ideas through an orthogonal approach to SA that directly leans on Data Visualization. Extracted sentiments, with respect to some query of analysis, are ordered and represented graphically in a 2-dimensional space, conveying information about their strength and variability. This way, we avoid cumbersome rankings of objects and associated opinions by directly mapping such information on the screen. The user is then able to interact with the visualized data in order to discover interesting facts as well as removing false positive (or negative) opinions deriving by the used algorithm. We then evaluate the efficacy of the proposed system through several case studies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding e-government discourses is significant, since these discourses represent contested visions of e-government, and one can derive a feel for public sentiment about e-government from the discourses used in the media. The findings are accumulated through an inductive analysis of 85 newspaper articles, published during the year of 2010, in three top-selling, ideologically different, nationally circulating Turkish newspapers. In these 85 articles, 98 discourses presented by 90 policy actors are found. Five positive and four negative discourse categories and their relationships emerged from the analysis of the data. The results show that, government reform efforts shaped by the New Public Management movement and Turkey's harmonization efforts with the global political system in general, and with the European Union in particular, are influential in the presentation of e-government projects to the Turkish public through newspapers. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Discourse analysis; E-government; European Union; Government reform; New public management; Public value; Turkey,,2-s2.0-84875384647

Through analysis of these heated polemics, the book shows how Trinitarian God-Talk became untenable in many ecclesiastical and philosophical circles, which led to the emergence of Unitarianism. It also demonstrates that those who continued to embrace Trinitarian doctrine articulated their piety and theological perspectives in an increasingly secularized culture of discourse. Drawing on both unexplored manuscripts and well-known treatises of Continental and English provenance, the book unearths the complex layers of the polemic: from biblical exegesis to reception history of patristic authorities, from popular religious radicalism during the Civil War to Puritan spirituality, from Continental Socinians to English Anti-Trinitarians who avowed their relative independent theological identity, from the notion of the Platonic captivity of primitive Christianity to that of Plato as ""Moses Atticus."" Among this book's surprising conclusions are the findings that Anti-Trinitarian sentiment arose from a Puritan ambience, in which Biblical literalism overcame rationalistic presuppositions, and that theology and philosophy were not as unconnected during this period as previously thought. © Oxford University Press, 2014.",Anti-trinitarian sentiment; Christianity; God-talk; Plato; Polemical debates; Politics of religion; Seventeenth-century england; Trinity; Unitarianism,,2-s2.0-84900837997

Identifying sentiments expressed by members in a health community can be helpful in understanding dynamics of the community such as dominant health issues, emotional impacts of interactions on members, etc. In this work, we perform sentiment classification of user posts in an online cancer support community (Cancer Survivors Network).

They can help people understand the brand perception and customer opinions from social media, such as online posts, tweets, forums, and blogs. As such, in recent years, many solutions have been proposed for both tasks. However, we believe that the following two problems have not been addressed adequately: (1) Conventional solutions usually treat the two tasks in isolation. When the two tasks are closely related (e.g., posts about ""customer care"" often have a ""negative"" tone), exploring their correlation may yield a better accuracy; (2) Each post is usually assigned with only one sentiment label and one topic label. Since social media is, compared to traditional document corpus, more noisy, ambiguous, and sparser, single label classification may not be able to capture the post classes accurately. To address these two problems, in this paper, we propose a multi-task multi-label (MTML) classification model that performs classification of both sentiments and topics concurrently. It incorporates results of each task from prior steps to promote and reinforce the other iteratively. For each task, the model is trained with multiple labels so that they can help address class ambiguity. In the empirical validation, we compare the accuracy of MTML model against four competing methods in two different settings. Results show that MTML produces a much higher accuracy of both sentiment and topic classifications.

The capacity to provide information in real time has stimulated many companies to use this service to understand their consumers. In this direction, TV stations have adopted Twitter for shortening the distance between them and their viewers, and use such information as a feedback mechanism for their shows. The sentiment analysis task can be used as one such feedback mechanism. This task corresponds to classifying a text according to the sentiment that the writer intended to transmit. A classifier usually requires a pre-classifled data sample to determine the class of new data. Typically, the sample is pre-classified manually, making the process time consuming and reducing its real time applicability for big data. This paper proposes an automatic sentiment classifier for Twitter messages, and uses TV shows from Brazilian stations for benchmarking. The automatic sentiment analysis reduces human intervention and, thus, the complexity and cost of the whole process. To assess the performance of the proposed system tweets related to a Brazilian TV show were captured in a 24h interval and fed into the system.

Such sentiment-related distinctions are important for many kinds of analysis and applications, such as community recommendation. We present a novel approach to identification of latent hyper-groups in social communities based on users' sentiment.

This paper builds on the previous work on textual sentiment analysis to investigate whether information in the speech signal can be used to predict sentiment from short spoken reviews. For this purpose we collected a short spoken reviews from 84 speakers. Results show that models trained on features characterizing the review's pitch significantly outperform a majority class baseline, without textual information.

Generally, topics that involve bipolar or competing viewpoints are attention getting and are thus reported in a large number of documents. Identifying the association between important persons mentioned in numerous topic documents would help readers comprehend topics more easily. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach for identifying bipolar person names in a set of topic documents. Specifically, we employ principal component analysis (PCA) to discover bipolar word usage patterns of person names in the documents, and show that the signs of the entries in the principal eigenvector of PCA partition the person names into bipolar groups spontaneously. To reduce the effect of data sparseness, we introduce two techniques, called the weighted correlation coefficient and off-topic block elimination. We also present a timeline system that shows the intensity and activeness development of the identified bipolar person groups. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in identifying bipolar person names in topic documents, while the generated timelines provide comprehensive storylines of topics. © 2012 IEEE.",bipolar timeline; sentiment analysis; Topic mining,bipolar timeline; Bipolarization; Data sparseness; Empirical evaluations; Principal eigen-vector; Sentiment analysis; Specific time; Storylines; Unsupervised approaches; Usage patterns; Weighted correlation; Computational methods; Information systems; Principal component analysis,2-s2.0-84255206619

We discern and test two contradictory accounts of the impact of globalization on anti-immigrant prejudice from the prejudice and globalization literatures. On the one hand, there is the 'civilizing/integrative globalization' thesis, which implies that globalization should help to decrease prejudice by creating sustained and equal contact between previously alien cultures and peoples, and by spreading economic gains to everybody. On the other hand, there is the 'destructive globalization/globalization as a threat' thesis, which argues that globalization should increase anti-immigrant prejudice by intensifying competition over resources and by increasing perceived threat by native populations as a result of increasing immigrant populations. We test these two accounts using a multi-level analysis of 64 countries and nearly 150,000 individuals, derived from the World Values Surveys (waves 3-5). Our analyses reveal support for 'destructive globalization/ globalization as a threat' thesis, but emphasize the multi-dimensional character of globalization. We find that citizens of countries with higher levels of trade openness have significantly more anti-immigrant sentiments. There is also some evidence that in countries where unemployment is accompanied by high levels of trade openness or the existence of large immigrant populations, citizens hold high anti-immigrant prejudice. By contrast, foreign direct investment (FDI) has a weak effect. © The Author(s) 2012.",anti-immigrant prejudice; civilizing globalization; destructive globalization,civil society; competition (economics); foreign direct investment; globalization; hypothesis testing; immigrant population; immigration; resource allocation; socioeconomic status; theoretical study,2-s2.0-84861875483

Providers of such content exert a certain level of influence on the receivers and this is evident from blog sites having effect on their readers' purchase decisions, political view points, financial planning, and others. By detecting the opinion expressed, we can identify the sentiments on the topics discussed and the influence exerted on the readers. In this paper, we introduce an automatic approach in deriving polarity pattern rules to detect sentiment polarity at the phrase level, and in addition consider the effects of the more complex relationships found between words in sentiment polarity classification. Recent sentiment analysis research has focused on the functional relations of words using typed dependency parsing, providing a refined analysis on the grammar and semantics of textual data. Heuristics are typically used to determine the typed dependency polarity patterns, which may not comprehensively identify all possible rules. We study the use of class sequential rules (CSRs) to automatically learn the typed dependency patterns, and benchmark the performance of CSR against a heuristic method. Preliminary results show CSR leads to further improvements in classification performance achieving over 80% F1 scores in the test cases. In addition, we observe more complex relationships between words that could influence phrase sentiment polarity, and further discuss on possible approaches to handle the effects of these complex relationships. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC & Science Press, China.",Class sequential rule; Complex phrase; Sentiment analysis; Typed dependency,Classification performance; Complex phrase; Complex relationships; Dependency parsing; Financial planning; Functional relation; Polarity classification; Possible rule; Purchase decision; Refined analysis; Rule based; Sentiment analysis; Sequential rule; Test case; Textual data; Typed dependency; User-generated content; Web 2.0; Data mining; Formal languages; Heuristic methods; Semantics; Benchmarking,2-s2.0-84861739949

It aims to classify the sentences into positive, negative, or objective. One can consider sentence sentiment classification as a standard text categorization problem. However, determining the sentiment orientation of a review sentence requires more than the features inside the sentence itself, especially for the sentences with little or ambiguous inside sentence features. Through observing, some features outside the sentence can interact with its inside features to enhance the overall performance of sentence sentiment classification. Thus in this paper, we propose two such outside sentence features: intra-document evidence and inter-document evidence. Then in order to improve the sentence sentiment classification performance, a graph-based propagation approach is presented to incorporate these inside and outside sentence features. The experimental results on camera domain show that the proposed approach performs better than the approaches without using outside sentence features, and outperforms other representational previous approaches. © 2010 Acta Automatica Sinica.

He argues that this new Kurdish image demonstrates the ethnicization of longstanding anti-migrant sentiments in Turkey. He develops and substantiates the argument by means of qualitative data gathered in a field study in İzmir between June 2006 and July 2007. The study involved ninety indepth interviews with middle-class individuals living in the city and explored their anti-Kurdish attitudes. Through a close analysis of two of the common stereotypes that these interviewees deployed in the interviews-namely, that the Kurds were 'benefit scroungers' and that they 'disrupt urban life'- Saraçoǧlu explores the formation of the urban social context in which such perceptions have emerged. Close examination of the narratives of the middle-class respondents indicates that the development of a new image of the Kurds has occurred in an urban context shaped by the neoliberal transformation of Turkish cities, on the one hand, and the internal displacement of Kurdish migrants, on the other. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Exclusion; İzmir; Internal displacement; Kurds; Migration; Nationalism; Neoliberalism; Racism; Stereotypes; Turkey; Urban studies,"article; civil rights; economics; education; ethnic group; ethnology; health; history; human; legal aspect; migration; minority group; psychological aspect; social behavior; social class; social psychology; social status; Turkey (republic); urban population; Civil Rights; Ethnic Groups; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Minority Groups; Social Class; Social Conditions; Social Identification; Stereotyping; Transients and Migrants; Turkey; Urban Health; Urban Population",2-s2.0-77954230884

Koselleck is well-known for his work on conceptual history as well as for his theory of historical time(s). It is my contention that these different projects are bound together by Koselleck's Historik, that is, his theory of possible histories. This can be shown through an examination of his writings from Critique and Crisis to his final essays on historical anthropology, most of which have not yet been translated into English. Conversely, Arendt's political theory has in recent years been the subject of numerous interpretations that do not take into account her views about history. By comparing the anthropological categories found in Koselleck's Historik with Arendt's political anthropology, I identify similar intellectual lineages in them (Heidegger, Löwith, Schmitt) as well as shared political sentiments, in particular the anti-totalitarian impulse of the postwar era. More importantly, Koselleck's theory of the preconditions of possible histories and Arendt's theory of the preconditions of the political, I argue, transcend these lineages and sentiments by providing essential categories for the analysis of historical experience. © 2010 Wesleyan University.",Anthropology; Conceptual history; Experience; Hannah Arendt; Political theory; Reinhart Koselleck,,2-s2.0-77952327101

The most common text classification approach uses a document's ngrams (words and short phrases) as its features and assigns feature values equal to their frequency or TFIDF score relative to the training corpus. Our approach uses values computed as the product of an ngram's document frequency and the difference of its inverse document frequencies in the positive and negative training sets. While this technique is remarkably easy to implement, it gives a statistically significant improvement over the standard bag-of-words approaches using support vector machines on a range of classification tasks. Our results show that our technique is robust and broadly applicable. We provide an analysis of why the approach works and how it can generalize to other domains and problems.

Therefore, an increase in consumer confidence should translate into higher rates of consumption in the future, leading to a possible rise in economic growth. Our panel data analysis, conducting panel unit root tests and panel cointegration tests, tries to measure the effects of changes in consumer sentiment on personal consumption expenditures while accounting for other significant economic and financial variables such as stock exchange index, real exchange rates and interest rates.

This claim, supported by both logic and evidence, has long been the major contribution of rational choice scholarship. Rational choice has conclusively lain to rest the pluralist myth that individual interest automatically leads to collective action or that collective action necessarily produces a collective good. The guiding insight has a long heritage, dating back at least to Hobbes's Leviathan (1985 [1651]) and to Mandeville's Fable of the Bees (1924 [1714]). However, it rests on an impoverished model of human action and society. Even the great Adam Smith recognized this. Famous for The Wealth of Nations, in which he identifies the conditions under which following personal self-interest makes everyone (or almost everyone) better off, he also authored The Theory of Moral Sentiments, in which he states that values may trump interests. Comparative and historical rational choice demands theoretically informed empirical investigations of variations in aggregate behavior and collective outcomes derived from models of strategically interacting individuals making reasoned choices subject to constraints. Rational choice analysis derives from but is decidedly not neoclassical economics. It has, at least in the work discussed in this chapter, a richer conception of reasoned choice, interactions, and constraints. Consequently, rationalists now can identify the conditions under which aggregations of rational individuals can produce optimal social outcomes. By recognizing differences in context and institutional arrangements, rationalists can elucidate why the same actors make different choices in different circumstances. © Cambridge University Press 2009.",,,2-s2.0-84923469481

By closely examining the political economy of the TV industry, audiences of the regional media flows in terms of gender subjectivity constructions, perceptions of colonial-postcolonial relationships and, nationalist responses to trans-national media culture exchanges, the essays highlight the multiple connectivities and socio-political implications of popular cultural flows and exchanges in East Asia.

It will suggest that French public attitudes towards the prospect of war can be better defined as 'war anxiety' rather than the value-laden term 'pacifism'. Taking as a test case the period between the Munich Agreement of September 1938 and the outbreak of the Second World War less than a year later, the article will tease out the necessary distinction between 'pacifism' and war anxiety. By employing a notion of 'representations' of public opinion, it will be shown how French opinion was demonstrably less pacifist than many existing analyses assume. Instead, it will be contended that the public's anxieties with regard to a future war manifested themselves in a variety of ways, of which pacifism was merely one example. Indeed, war anxiety increasingly demanded that France prepare for an inevitable conflict, in stark contrast to simply retreating into a defeatist mindset.

Family is both the genesis of alcohol problems (through parental consumption or supportive attitude) and a solution, via family therapy. In contrast, family is not the primary unit of direct socialisation to drug use. Rather, attributes of family (such as structure, sentiment, and activity) lead to youth delinquency, which results in drug use. These representations of family are based on taken-for-granted notions supporting a Parsonian-style structural-functionalism, highly influenced by Freudian psychoanalytic ideas. This theory of family, permeating and uniting otherwise separate literatures on alcohol and drugs, reduces complex concepts to simple, easily measured static attributes rather than developmental or social processes; uses a limited repertoire of predominantly quantitative methods; imposes unwarranted normative assumptions; and has investigated a truncated selection of topics. A call is made for expansion of the epistemological, theoretical and methodological bases, to include contemporary social theory, such as post-modern, practice theory or Foucauldian ideas, and a range of qualitative approaches when studying family and substance use.

In response to this problem, this paper provides an overview of the treatment of blacks and females from the opening of the nation's first juvenile reformatory-the New York House of Refuge, which opened in 1825—to the close of the nineteenth century. An examination of the annual reports of reformatories, as well as other primary data sources, reveals that nineteenth century child savers never intended the presumed benefits of reform to be applied equally to all children. Reformatory keepers, acting in accordance with racist and sexist sentiments which pervaded the nineteenth century social order, employed three versions of parens patriae: White males received the full benefits of reform and were trained as skilled artisans and farmers; black males were either denied admission or trained as manual laborers; and females were prepared for roles as wives and/or domestics. A brief review of contemporary practices is included to demonstrate that contemporary child savers have continued to distort the doctrine of parens patriae in accordance with racist and sexist sentiments, and provide blacks and females with different and less benevolent care than is provided to white males. © 1983, Sage Publications.

The main problem with ELM is in training them to work in the event of a large number of available samples, where the generalization performance has to be carefully assessed. For this reason, we propose an ELM implementation that exploits the Spark distributed in memory technology and show how to take advantage of the most recent advances in SLT in order to address the issue of selecting ELM hyperparameters that give the best generalization performance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",,Character recognition; Data handling; Information analysis; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Public relations; Amount of information; Backpropagation network; Extreme learning machine; Generalization performance; Natural language text; Scientific community; Statistical learning theory; Technological tools; Backpropagation,2-s2.0-84979680823

We propose new meta-level features especially designed for the sentiment analysis of short messages such as: (i) information derived from the sentiment distribution among the k nearest neighbors of a given short test document x, (ii) the distribution of distances of x to their neighbors and (iii) the document polarity of these neighbors given by unsupervised lexical-based methods. Our approach is also capable of exploiting information from the neighborhood of document x regarding (highly noisy) data obtained from 1.6 million Twitter messages with emoticons. The set of proposed features is capable of transforming the original feature space into a new one, potentially smaller and more informed. Experiments performed with a substantial number of datasets (nineteen) demonstrate that the effectiveness of the proposed sentiment-based meta-level features is not only superior to the traditional bag-of-word representation (by up to 16%) but is also superior in most cases to state-of-art meta-level features previously proposed in the literature for text classification tasks that do not take into account some idiosyncrasies of sentiment analysis. Our proposal is also largely superior to the best lexicon-based methods as well as to supervised combinations of them. In fact, the proposed approach is the only one to produce the best results in all tested datasets in all scenarios. © 2016 Association for Computing Machinery.",Meta features; Sentiment analysis,Classification (of information); Information retrieval; Nearest neighbor search; Text processing; Websites; World Wide Web; Bag of words; Feature space; K-nearest neighbors; Lexicon-based; Meta-features; Sentiment analysis; Short message; Text classification; Data mining,2-s2.0-84964341620

Moreover, the ways in which information quality relates to review helpfulness remain largely unknown. Hence, this paper seeks to answer the following two research questions: (1) How does the helpfulness of user-generated reviews vary as a function of review sentiment and product type? (2) How does information quality relate to the helpfulness of user-generated reviews across review sentiment and product type? Data included 2190 reviews drawn from Amazon for three search products - digital cameras, cell phones, and laser printers - as well as three experience products - books, skin care, and music albums. Review sentiment was ascertained based on star ratings. Investigation of the research questions relied on the statistical procedures of analysis of variance, and multiple regression. Review helpfulness was found to vary across review sentiment independent of product type. Besides, the relationship between information quality and review helpfulness was found to vary as a function of review sentiment as well as product type. The paper concludes with a number of implications for research and practice. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This information can be used for several purposes, such as to understand consumers and their preferences. In this direction, the sentiment analysis can be used as a feedback mechanism. This analysis corresponds to classifying a text according to the sentiment that the writer intended to transmit. A basic sentiment classifier determines the sentiment polarity (negative, neutral or positive) of a given text at the document, sentence, or feature/aspect level. Advanced types may consider other elements like the emotional state (e.g. angry, sad, happy), affective states (e.g. pleasure and pain), motivational states (e.g. hunger and curiosity), temperaments, among others. In general, there are two main approaches to attribute sentiment to tweets: based on knowledge; or based on machine learning algorithms. In the latter case, the learning algorithm requires a pre-classified data sample to determine the class of new data. Typically, the sample is pre-classified manually, making the process time consuming and reducing its real time applicability for big data. This paper proposes a polarity analysis framework for Twitter messages, which combines both approaches and an automatic contextual module. To assess the performance of the proposed framework, four text datasets from the literature are used. Five different types of classifiers were considered: Naïve Bayes (NB); Support Vector Machines (SVM); Decision Trees (J48); and Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The results show that the proposal is a suitable framework to automate the whole polarity analysis process, providing high accuracy levels and low false positive rates. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We collected a training corpus of about 406 thousand Dutch tweets with hashtag synonyms denoting sarcasm. Assuming that the human labeling is correct (annotation of a sample indicates that about 90% of these tweets are indeed sarcastic), we train a machine learning classifier on the harvested examples, and apply it to a sample of a day's stream of 2.25 million Dutch tweets. Of the 353 explicitly marked tweets on this day, we detect 309 (87%) with the hashtag removed. We annotate the top of the ranked list of tweets most likely to be sarcastic that do not have the explicit hashtag. 35% of the top-250 ranked tweets are indeed sarcastic. Analysis indicates that the use of hashtags reduces the further use of linguistic markers for signaling sarcasm, such as exclamations and intensifiers. We hypothesize that explicit markers such as hashtags are the digital extralinguistic equivalent of non-verbal expressions that people employ in live interaction when conveying sarcasm. Checking the consistency of our finding in a language from another language family, we observe that in French the hashtag '#sarcasme' has a similar polarity switching function, be it to a lesser extent. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The spammers significantly hinder the use of social media systems for effective information dissemination and sharing. Different from the spammers in traditional platforms such as email and the Web, spammers in social media can easily connect with each other, sometimes without mutual consent. They collude with each other to imitate normal users by quickly accumulating a large number of 'human' friends. In addition, content information in social media is noisy and unstructured. It is infeasible to directly apply traditional spammer detection methods in social media. Understanding and detecting deception has been extensively studied in traditional sociology and social sciences. Motivated by psychological findings in physical world, we investigate whether sentiment analysis can help spammer detection in online social media. In particular, we first conduct an exploratory study to analyze the sentiment differences between spammers and normal users, and then present an optimization formulation that incorporates sentiment information into a novel social spammer detection framework.

The results indicate that consumers show diminishing returns to active firm engagement, which, at very high levels, can undermine consumer sentiment. Further subgroup analyses by conversation type indicate that these relationships hold for conversations that address consumers' functional needs but do not hold for conversations that address social needs. Finally, the results show diminishing returns to firm engagement for consumers primarily interested in product-related support but show no relationship for consumers primarily interested in inspiration and entertainment.

Given a document as the input, document-level sentiment analysis aims to automatically classify its sentiment/opinion (such as thumbs up or thumbs down ) based on the textural in-formation. Despite the success of feature engineering in many previous studies, the hand-coded features do not well capture the semantics of texts. In this research, we argue that learning sentiment-specific semantic representations of documents is crucial for document-level sentiment analysis. We decompose the document semantics into four cascad-ed constitutes: (1) word representation, (2) sentence struc-ture, (3) sentence composition and (4) document compo-sition. Specifically, we learn sentiment-specific word rep-resentations, which simultaneously encode the contexts of words and the sentiment supervisions of texts into the con-tinuous representation space. According to the principle of compositionality, we learn sentiment-specific sentence struc-tures and sentence-level composition functions to produce the representation of each sentence based on the representa-tions of the words it contains. The semantic representations of documents are obtained through document composition, which leverages the sentiment-sensitive discourse relations and sentence representations.

However, measuring positive tone requires the correct classification of sentences that are negated, i.e. The negation scopes. For example, around 4.74% of all sentences in German ad hoc announcements contain negations. To predict the corresponding negation scope, related literature commonly utilizes two approaches, namely, rule-based algorithms and machine learning. Nevertheless, a thorough comparison is missing, especially for the sentiment analysis of financial news. To close this gap, this paper uses German ad hoc announcements as a common example of financial news in order to pursue a two-sided evaluation. First, we compare the predictive performance using a manually-labeled dataset. Second, we examine how detecting negation scopes can improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.

However, it is difficult to extract important summary information from many millions of tweets sent every hour. In this work we propose a new concept, sentimental causal rules, and techniques for extracting sentimental causal rules from textual data sources such as Twitter which combine sentiment analysis and causal rule discovery. Sentiment analysis refers to the task of extracting public sentiment from textual data. The value in sentiment analysis lies in its ability to reflect popularly voiced perceptions that are stated in natural language. Causal rules on the other hand indicate associations between different concepts in a context where one (or several concepts) cause(s) the other(s). We believe that sentimental causal rules are an effective summarization mechanism that combine causal relations among different aspects extracted from textual data as well as the sentiment embedded in these causal relationships. In order to show the effectiveness of sentimental causal rules, we have conducted experiments on Twitter data collected on the Kurdish political issue in Turkey which has been an ongoing heated public debate for many years. Our experiments on Twitter data show that sentimental causal rule discovery is an effective method to summarize information about important aspects of an issue in Twitter which may further be used by politicians for better policy making. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this paper is to propose an opinion-aware analytical framework-PRODWeakFinder-to expect to detect product weaknesses through sentiment analysis in an effective way.Design/methodology/approach-PRODWeakFinder detects product weakness by considering both comparative and non-comparative evaluations in online reviews. For comparative evaluation, an aspect-oriented comparison network is built, and the authority is assessed for each node by network analysis. For non-comparative evaluation, sentiment score is calculated through sentiment analysis. The composite score of aspects is calculated by combing the two types of evaluations.Findings-The experiments show that the comparative authority score and the non-comparative sentiment score are not highly correlated. It also shows that PRODWeakFinder outperforms the baseline methods in terms of accuracy.Research limitations/implications-Semantic-based method such as ontology are expected to be applied to identify the implicit features. Furthermore, besides PageRank, other sophisticated network algorithms such as HITS will be further employed to improve the framework.Practical implications-The link-based network is more suitable for weakness detection than the weight-based network. PRODWeakFinder shows the potential on reducing overall costs of detecting product weaknesses for companies.Social implications-A quicker and more effective way would be possible for weakness detection, enabling to reduce product defects and improve product quality, and thus raising the overall social welfare.Originality/value-An opinion-aware analytical framework is proposed to sentiment mining of online product reviews, which offer important implications regarding how to detect product weaknesses. © 2014 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Comparison network; Online review; Product aspect; Product weakness; PRODWeakFinder; Sentiment analysis,Comparison networks; Online reviews; Product aspects; Product weakness; PRODWeakFinder; Sentiment analysis,2-s2.0-84908464571

The intuition behind topic models is that, by generating documents by latent topics, the word distribution for each topic can be modelled and the prior distribution over the topic learned. In this paper we propose to apply this concept by modelling the topics of sentences for the aspect detection problem in review documents in order to improve sentiment analysis systems. Aspect detection in sentiment analysis helps customers effectively navigate into detailed information about their features of interest. The proposed approach assumes that the aspects of words in a sentence form a Markov chain. The novelty of the model is the extraction of multiword aspects from text data while relaxing the bag-of-words assumption. Experimental results show that the model is indeed able to perform the task significantly better when compared with standard topic models. © The Author(s) 2014.",Aspect detection; Latent Dirichlet Allocation; opinion mining; sentiment analysis; topic model,Detection models; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Topic Modeling,2-s2.0-84907098242

Underlying assumptions for this research stream on predictive analytics are that social media actions such as tweeting, liking, commenting and rating are proxies for user/consumer's attention to a particular object/product and that the shared digital artefact that is persistent can create social influence. In this paper, we demonstrate how social media data from twitter can be used to predict the sales of iPhones. Based on a conceptual model of social data consisting of social graph (actors, actions, activities, and artefacts) and social text (topics, keywords, pronouns, and sentiments), we develop and evaluate a linear regression model that transforms iPhone tweets into a prediction of the quarterly iPhone sales with an average error close to the established prediction models from investment banks. This strong correlation between iPhone tweets and iPhone sales becomes marginally stronger after incorporating sentiments of tweets. We discuss the findings and conclude with implications for predictive analytics with big social data. © 2014 IEEE.",computational social science; Data science; iphone sales; iphone tweets; predictive analytics; social data analytics; twitter,Behavioral research; Economics; Forecasting; Investments; Linear regression; Mathematical transformations; Regression analysis; Sales; Social networking (online); Social sciences; Computational social science; Data science; iphone tweets; Predictive analytics; Social datum; twitter; Smartphones,2-s2.0-84937390668

Our case study builds on extensive data sets from the project's bug tracking platform BUGZILLA, to quantify the activity of contributors, and its mail archives, to quantify the emotions of contributors by means of sentiment analysis. The GENTOO project is known for a period of centralization within its bug triaging community. This was followed by considerable changes in community organization and performance after the sudden retirement of the central contributor. We analyze how this event correlates with the negative emotions, both in bilateral email discussions with the central contributor, and at the level of the whole community of contributors. We then extend our study to consider the activity patterns of GENTOO contributors in general. We find that contributors are more likely to become inactive when they express strong positive or negative emotions in the bug tracker, or when they deviate from the expected value of emotions in the mailing list. We use these insights to develop a Bayesian classifier that detects the risk of contributors leaving the project. Our analysis opens new perspectives for measuring online contributor motivation by means of sentiment analysis and for real-time predictions of contributor turnover in Open Source Software projects. © 2013 IEEE.",,Activity patterns; Bayesian classifier; Community organizations; Expected values; Mailing lists; Open source software projects; Real-time prediction; Sentiment analysis; Software engineering; Data mining,2-s2.0-84893310486

This study examines the consequences and psychological processes of (dis)similar levels of LMX on the interpersonal interactions between coworkers. Using data from 2 independent studies, the results of social relations analyses show that (a) actual (dis)similarity in LMX between Coworkers A and B increases oworker A's feelings of contempt for Coworker B and decreases Coworker A's perception of help received from Coworker B (Study 1); (b) Coworker A is more likely to experience contempt for oworker B when Coworker A perceives that he/she has a higher or lower level of LMX compared toCoworker B than when Coworker A perceives that his/her level of LMX is similar to Coworker B's(Study 2); and (c) these relationships only hold true for employees with a high social comparison orientation (SCO) in both Studies 1 and 2. Particularly, in Study 1, we also show that contempt is a rucial mediator that transmits the interactive effect of LMX (dis)similarity and SCO on perceptions of elp received from coworkers.

In our approach we do not describe images based on their properties only, but also in the context of semantically related images, which improves robustness and effectively enables propagation of sentiment, aesthetic appeal as well as various inherent attributes associated with a particular group of images. We discuss the phenomenon of a low inter-user agreement, which makes an automatic evaluation of visual summaries a challenging task and propose a solution inspired by the text summarization and machine translation communities.

Manual content coding, corpus-based semantic analysis, and stance-shift analysis represent methods varying greatly in both process and output. For illustration purposes, they are applied in an exploratory study focused on consumers' reaction to farm stays in order to demonstrate how large volumes of qualitative data can be analyzed quantitatively in a relatively efficient and reliable way. A total of 800 narratives describing farm stay experiences and representing four national settings (Australia, Italy, UK, and USA) was collected. The results reveal that each method provides unique insights of what a farm stay vacation evokes, helpful to farm entrepreneurs wishing to develop a tourism business. The findings indicate universal values as recurrent key drivers of customer satisfaction closely relate to rural experiences. Comparing the national datasets, local differences are evident, highlighting regional variations in terms of service products and consumer preferences. From a methodological viewpoint, all three methods produce reliable results by evidence of the similarities across all three analyses.

Our findings contribute to the open question whether the political social media ecosphere is fragmented or not, whether the structure of the social network influences communication flow and sentiment among members of the medium. The analysis of the network shows that the majority of connections were established between members of the same party while connections between different parties were significantly less represented. An analysis of the exchanged tweets demonstrated that the majority of discussions took place between members of the same party cluster and was more positive towards members of the same political party rather than towards members of other political parties. © 2013, First Monday. © 2013, Thomas Plotkowiak and Katarina Stanoevska-Slabeva.",,,2-s2.0-84878997718

An established approach to assessing operational capabilities is the maturity model methodology where the emphasis is on notions of evolution and levels of process formality. More recently, there has been a growing emphasis on sustainable supply networks, driving industrial practitioners to also address energy and resource efficiencies and waste minimisation. However, quantitative measurement approaches such as carbon footprinting beyond the firm boundary are complex and resource intensive and present significant validation challenges. This article proposes a process maturity model-based alternative to supply network carbon measurement approaches, namely, the systematic review of organisational routines and practices relevant to sustainable manufacturing. Furthermore, the incorporation of sustainability dimensions within an established supply chain maturity model architecture provides a basis for potential trade-offs. Application of the maturity model framework in 12 case studies of international manufacturing multinationals is presented, demonstrating feasibility and utility of the approach and identifying potential drivers for manufacturing sustainability linked to the industrial supply network position, including the regulatory context, and consumer sentiment. © IMechE 2013.",Maturity models; Supply network capabilities; Sustainable supply networks,Capability maturity models; Industrial practitioners; Maturity model; Operational capabilities; Quantitative measurement; Supply networks; Sustainability dimensions; Sustainable manufacturing; Carbon; Conservation; Cost accounting; Manufacture; Software engineering; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Complex networks,2-s2.0-84879318762

Building on information economics, we propose that CCOs influence investors' sentiments toward an IPO and that both IPO-specific variables (which influence the credibility of CCO information) and facets of the organizational institutional and task environments (which influence the appropriateness of CCO information) moderate this influence. We test the framework using data collected from computer-aided text analysis, expert coders, and secondary sources for 543 IPOs across 43 industries between 2000 and 2004. A Bayesian shrinkage model, which accounts for industry-specific effects and uses latent instrumental variables to address CCO endogeneity, shows that CCOs positively influence IPO outcomes. Furthermore, (1) underwriter reputation and venture funding positively moderate the effects of CCOs; (2) technological and market turbulence positively and institutional complexity negatively moderate the effect of customer orientation; and (3) technological turbulence, competitive intensity, and institutional complexity positively moderate the effect of competitor orientation. Also, accounting for endogeneity using latent instrumental variables substantially improves the predictive validity of the model, relative to alternative model specifications. © 2013 INFORMS.",Cheap talk; Competitor orientation; Content analysis; Costly state falsification; Customer orientation; Hierarchical bayesian analysis; Information economics; Initial public offering; Institutional environment; Latent instrumental variables,,2-s2.0-84873301123

More importantly, JAS exploits sentiment prior and aspect-contextual sentence-level co-occurrences of opinion words in reviews to further identify aspect-aware sentiment polarities for the opinion words. We apply the learned aspect-specific sentiment knowledge to practical aspect-level sentiment analysis tasks.

Such opinions are important for commercial and governmental organization since they help checking public opinion about a product, policy or an object in general. In this paper we present the application of two different approaches to classify Arabic Facebook posts. The first one depends on syntactic features, using common patterns used in different Arabic dialects to express opinions. These patterns achieved high accuracy in determining the polarity of a sentiment even when tested against new corpus. This approach acts on informal Arabic text, which has not been addressed before. Different setups were tried and the highest coverage and accuracy achieved were 49.5% and 83.4 % respectively.

Most existing CF methods rely only on users'overall ratings of items, ignoring the variety of opinions users may have towards different aspects of the items. Using the movie domain as a case study, we propose a framework that is able to capture users'opinions on different aspects from the textual reviews, and use that information to improve the effectiveness of CF. This framework has two components, an opinion mining component and a rating inference component. The former extracts and summarizes the opinions on multiple aspects from the reviews, generating ratings on the various aspects. The latter component, on the other hand, infers the overall ratings of items based on the aspect ratings, which forms the basis for item recommendation. Our core contribution is in the proposal of a tensor factorization approach for the rating inference. Operating on the tensor composed of the overall and aspect ratings, this approach is able to capture the intrinsic relationships between users, items, and aspects, and provide accurate predictions on unknown ratings. Experiments on a movie dataset show that our proposal significantly improves the prediction accuracy compared with two baseline methods. © 2012 IEEE.",Collaborative filtering; Opinion mining; Recommendation system; Sentiment analysis; Tensor factorization,Accurate prediction; Baseline methods; Opinion mining; Prediction accuracy; Sentiment analysis; Tensor factorization; Two-component; Data mining; Factorization; Recommender systems; Tensors; Collaborative filtering,2-s2.0-84874067633

We conduct the VIX-returns analysis for the 1993-2007 period. Our results suggest a strong negative contemporaneous relation between daily changes (innovations) in VIX and U.S. stock market returns. This relation is stronger when VIX is higher and more volatile. A significant negative contemporaneous relation between VIX and equity returns also exists for China and Brazil during 1993-2007 and for India during 1993-1997. Similar to the U.S. market, the immediate negative relation between the Brazilian stock returns and VIX changes is much stronger when VIX is both high and more volatile. Our results also indicate a strong asymmetric relation between innovations in VIX and daily stock market returns in U.S., Brazil, and China, suggesting that VIX is more of a gauge of investor fear than investor positive sentiment. However, the asymmetric relationship between stock market returns and VIX is much weaker when VIX is large and more volatile. These results have potential implications for portfolio diversification and for stock market and option trading timing in the equity markets of Brazil, India, and China. Overall, our results indicate that VIX is not only an investor fear gauge for the U.S. stock market but also for the equity markets of China, Brazil, and India. © 2012.",BRIC; Fear gauge; VIX; Volatility,,2-s2.0-84861772105

One is by modifying the Dirichlet prior for topic-word distribution (LDA-DP), the other is by augmenting the model objective function through adding terms that express preferences on expectations of sentiment labels of the lexicon words using generalized expectation criteria (LDA-GE). We conducted extensive experiments on English movie review data and multi-domain sentiment dataset as well as Chinese product reviews about mobile phones, digital cameras, MP3 players, and monitors. The results show that while both LDA-DP and LDAGE perform comparably to existing weakly supervised sentiment classification algorithms, they are much simpler and computationally efficient, rendering themmore suitable for online and real-time sentiment classification on the Web. We observed that LDA-GE is more effective than LDA-DP, suggesting that it should be preferred when considering employing the topic model for sentiment analysis. Moreover, both models are able to extract highly domain-salient polarity words from text. © 2012 ACM.",Generalized expectation; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Sentiment analysis; Weakly supervised sentiment classification,Computationally efficient; Data sets; Dirichlet prior; Generalized expectation; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Lexicon words; MP-3 players; Multi domains; Objective functions; Prior knowledge; Product reviews; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Topic model; Statistics; Data mining,2-s2.0-84863688889

While Information Extraction and other text mining software can, in principle, be developed for many languages, most text analysis tools have only been applied to small sets of languages because the development effort per language is large. Self-training tools obviously alleviate the problem, but even the effort of providing training data and of manually tuning the results is usually considerable. In this paper, we gather insights by various multilingual system developers on how to minimise the effort of developing natural language processing applications for many languages. We also explain the main guidelines underlying our own effort to develop complex text mining software for tens of languages. While these guidelines-most of all: extreme simplicity-can be very restrictive and limiting, we believe to have shown the feasibility of the approach through the development of the Europe Media Monitor (EMM) family of applications (http://emm.newsbrief.eu/overview.html). EMM is a set of complex media monitoring tools that process and analyse up to 100,000 online news articles per day in between twenty and fifty languages. We will also touch upon the kind of language resources that would make it easier for all to develop highly multilingual text mining applications.

In our research, we propose to use Twitter, the most popular microblogging platform nowadays, to collect a dataset of emotional texts in French. Using the collected dataset, we estimated affective norms of words to construct an affective lexicon, which we use for polarity classification of video game reviews. Experimental results show that our method performs comparably to classic supervised learning methods. © 2011 IEEE.",Affective lexicon; Sentiment analysis; Twitter,Affective lexicon; Language resources; Micro-blogging platforms; Opinion mining; Polarity classification; Sentiment analysis; Supervised learning methods; Twitter; Classification (of information); Data processing; Expert systems; Social networking (online); Data mining,2-s2.0-84879744302

In this paper, we propose a practical unsupervised approach to improve user experience when exploring photo collections by using opinions and sentiments expressed in user comments on the uploaded photos. While most existing techniques concentrate on binary (negative or positive) opinion orientation, we use a real-valued scale for modeling opinion and sentiment strengths. We extract two types of sentiments: opinions that relate to the photo quality and general sentiments targeted towards objects depicted on the photo. Our approach combines linguistic features for part of speech tagging, traditional statistical methods for modeling word importance in the photo comment corpora (in a realvalued scale), and a predefined sentiment lexicon for detecting negative and positive opinion orientation. In addition, a semiautomatic photo feature detection method is applied and a set of syntactic patterns is introduced to resolve opinion references. We implemented a prototype system that incorporates the proposed approach and evaluates it on several regions in the World using real data extracted from Flickr. © 2010 IEEE.",,Customer review; Feature detection; Internet services; Linguistic features; Part of speech tagging; Photo collections; Photo quality; Prototype system; Sentiment analysis; Syntactic patterns; Unsupervised approaches; User attitudes; User experience; User-generated content; Computer science; Information technology; Web services; Internet,2-s2.0-79551546375

This paper, grounded in a Bourdieusian understanding of class, engages with this prominent assertion through analysis of 55 life-history interviews with people from a mix of class positions. It reveals that though individualistic sentiments are present, the respondents were all too ready to cite various forms of capital as advantages or disadvantages as well, though the degree to which they were seen as 'external' or 'individualised' differed by class. Furthermore, when 'class' was brought explicitly into the frame it was generally seen as a playing a fundamental role in life's trajectory, but mainly through issues of interaction and (mis)recognition rather than deprivation and inequality. Insofar as individualistic schemes of perception and class thus intertwine these processes could be said to represent what Beck refers to as a 'both/and' situation, but since they are neither particularly new nor damaging to class analysis the individualisation thesis is put in doubt. © Socioligical Research Online, 1996-2010.",Bauman; Beck; Bourdieu; Capital; Class; Individualisation; Self-perception,,2-s2.0-79956306013

In this paper, a novel combined model based on phrase and sentence level's analyses and a discussion on the complementation of different levels' analyses are presented. For the phrase-level sentiment analysis, a newly defined Left-Middle-Right template and the Conditional Random Fields are used to extract the sentiment words.

For subtopic identification, candidate phrases are generated and checked for containing five different features, some of which attempts to capture the relationship between the identified issue phrase and the candidate subtopic phrase.

When a user enters one or more query keywords, the sentiment map not only retrieves news articles related to the concerned topic, but also summarizes sentiment tendencies of Web news based on specific geographical scales. Sentiments can be automatically aggregated at different levels corresponding to the change of map scales.

In this chapter we describe a method for the automatic determination of complex sentiment-related attributes such as attitude type and force, by applying supervised learning to WordNet glosses.

While much sociolegal research has focused on the exercise of power in the legal process through the control of meaning in verbal, private face-to-face interactions, this article reveals similar meaning-making processes at play in publicly disseminated writing where the audience is far larger, the potential impact far wider, and the role of the state far greater. Lawyer Bao's popular image as valiant defender of ordinary people in trouble obscured and thus enhanced both the degree to which he was beholden to the state and the effectiveness with which he did the bidding of the state against the interests of the very letter-writers he purported to help. His ultimate allegiance to the state is reflected in two empirical patterns. First, the temporal distribution of problem topics featured in the DLB column corresponds less to shifts in public sentiment or objective popular needs and more to legislation, policy shifts, and political campaigns. Second, whether Lawyer Bao legitimized or delegitimized letter-writers' claims was determined primarily by the extent to which state interests were at stake in the problem at hand. Lawyer Bao tended to delegitimize labor grievances, housing demolition grievances, collective grievances of any kind, and other claims construed as potentially destabilizing or of challenge to state priorities. © 2008 by Society for the Study of Social Problems, Inc.",,,2-s2.0-39049147189

One key difficulty is that relevant assessments scattered throughout web pages are obscured by variations in natural language. In this paper, we focus on a novel aspect of enabling aggregations of assessments of degree to which a given property holds for a given entity (for instance, how touristy is Boston). We present GrainPile, a user interface for extracting from the web, aggregating and quantifying degree assessments of unconstrained topics. The interface provides a variety of functions: a) identification of dimensions of comparison (properties) relevant to a particular entity or set of entities, b) comparisons of like entities on user-specified properties (for example, which university is more prestigious, Yale or Cornell), c) tracing the derived opinions back to their sources (so that the reasons for the opinions can be found). A central contribution in GrainPile is the evaluated demonstration of feasibility of mapping the recognized expressions (such as fairly, very, extremely, and so on) to a common scale of numerical values and aggregating across all the extracted assessments to derive an overall assessment of degree. GrainPile's novel assessment and aggregation of degree expressions is shown to strongly outperform an interpretation-free, co-occurrence based method.

We estimate that in 2002, the effect of voter xenophobia was to reduce the voters' choice of public-sector size between 11% and 28% of one standard deviation of the population's distribution of public-sector size ideal points, from what it would have been, absent xenophobia. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",Distribution; Political equilibrium; Public sector; Racism; Xenophobia,,2-s2.0-27944496560

The study investigates the effectiveness of using a machine-learning algorithm, support vector machine (SVM), on various text features to classify on-line product reviews into recommended (positive sentiment) and not recommended (negative sentiment). In the first part of this study, several approaches, unigrams (individual words), selected words (such as verb, adjective, and adverb), and words labeled with part-of-speech tags were investigated. Using SVM, the unigram approach obtained an accuracy rate of around 76%. Error analysis suggests various approaches for improving classification accuracy: handling of negation phrases, inferencing from superficial words, and handling the problem of comments on parts of the product. The second part of the study investigated the use of negation phrase n-grams to improve classification accuracy. This approach increased the accuracy rate to 79.33%. Compared with traditional subject classification which mainly uses unigrams, syntactic and semantic processing of text appear more important for sentiment classification. We expect that deeper linguistic processing will help increase accuracy for sentiment classification. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,2-s2.0-24344499107

During both these wars, Russia has committed political errors and military crimes that have merited the criticism that they have received from Russians and Westerners alike. Yet while focusing upon the faulty execution of these wars, many critics have failed fully to consider the deeper causes behind them. Some observers have based their analyses upon assumptions and sentiments that have much to do with the myths of another historical era and little to do with the realities that have haunted the North Caucasus throughout the last decade. Indeed, many have failed to consider the region at all, preferring to see the conflicts along a North/South axis running from Moscow to Grozny while neglecting the tensions between Chechnya and its Caucasian neighbours to the East and West. The result of this neglect has often been a mix of misconceptions and partial truths that have only made it easier for Russian officials to dismiss legitimate criticism of their errors and excesses. Because it inadvertently strengthens the hands of hardliners on all sides, an imbalanced critique can only serve to perpetuate instability in Chechnya. Why has Chechnya spent the past 15 years lurching from one political failure to the next? The Chechen wars are mired within a multi-layered mythology that has flourished, in no small part, because this region is so little visited and so much misunderstood. © 2005 Wimbledon Publishing Company Ltd.",,,2-s2.0-34250898878

The wish for nearness and reassurance was followed by a wish 'to do something'. The latter, by necessity frustrated for most, was turned into identification with the new heroes who could 'do something': fire-fighters, steelworkers, and the politicians who presented themselves as organizers of their efforts. Analysis then concentrates on how these 'private wishes' were used for 'public politics' of a populist kind. Cultural norms and assumptions about family, community and masculinity were utilized for the mobilization of political attitudes of patriarchal protection, patriotism and retaliation. Social differences of victimization were denied (where in fact it can be shown that the financial upper class paid the highest toll) with the effect of creating the perfect 'populist moment' out of the situation on the basis of actual needs and sentiments.",,public attitude; social construction; urban politics; World Trade Center; United States,2-s2.0-0142228719

Detailed study of one such area using the enumerators' returns for the 1851 census reveals a marked though not total pattern of Irish residential segregation. It is argued that this reflects the nature of the urban environment and some traditional features of historic English nationalism. For Irish migrants, the great majority of whom came from a rural, Catholic and Gaelic-speaking background, the world's first industrial city was a profound culture shock. Moreover, though the situation in Manchester never reached the bitterness found in Liverpool, some other parts of northern England or central Scotland, there was still a tradition of anti-Catholic and anti-Irish sentiment. Analysis of broadside ballads reveals that within these districts, migrants retained a strong sense of being Irish and Catholic and an awareness of being merely one arm of an international Diaspora. But there is also a sense that these defensive reactions are partly motivated by the migrants' awareness that they were in danger of being absorbed by the cultural mores of the host society.",,"diaspora; immigrant population; migrants experience; nineteenth century; article; cultural factor; demography; education; ethnology; health; history; Ireland; legal aspect; migration; psychological aspect; social behavior; socioeconomics; United Kingdom; urban population; Acculturation; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Cultural Characteristics; Emigrants and Immigrants; Emigration and Immigration; Great Britain; History, 19th Century; Ireland; Residence Characteristics; Social Identification; Socioeconomic Factors; Urban Health; Urban Population; United Kingdom",2-s2.0-0033390203

Focusing on a survey of African-Americans, the ways in which majorities coerce and constrain minorities are analyzed. In particular, it is hypothesized that where communities are more racist, and more tolerant of racists, Blacks will perceive less freedom. The analysis takes advantage of a decade of surveys conducted by the General Social Surveys in developing measures of the degree of tolerance and racism in local communities, and then relates those measures to individual-level perceptions of freedom. A variety of contextual hypotheses is tested. The data indicate that anti-Black sentiment in the community does limit the freedom of African-Americans. What is more important, political tolerance in the community, even if it is tolerance of racists, contributes to both Black and White political freedom. Environments in which all ideas, even those that are repugnant and pernicious, can be expressed openly seem to create the conditions for individuals to express their political preferences. © 1995.",,African Americans; freedom perception; political freedom; political tolerance; racial attitude; USA,2-s2.0-0029540729

Those dependent variables are: support for self‐government, support for special status, and level of priority attached to Native issues. Multiple regression analysis and LISREL techniques are applied to data from a 1986 national random sample (N= 1834). The main findings are that: 1/ a moderate to large proportion of the variation in non‐aboriginal responses to aboriginal issues can be explained by three factors ‐prejudice, economic conservatism, and perceived conflict of group interests; 2/ prejudice and perceived conflict interact strongly in influencing non‐aboriginal Canadians' responses; 3/ ethnocentrism has a negligible to minor influence; and 4/ objective indicators (region, family SES and age) serving as proxies for perceived personal threat have only minor net effects on how Canadians respond to aboriginal issues.

It is typically preferred where sentiment labelled data is difficult to obtain or algorithm robustness across different domains is essential. A major challenge for this approach is accounting for the semantic gap between prior polarities of terms captured by a lexicon and the terms’ polarities in a specific context (contextual polarity). This is further exacerbated by the fact that a term's contextual polarity also depends on domains or genres in which it appears. In this paper, we introduce SMARTSA, a lexicon-based sentiment classification system for social media genres which integrates strategies to capture contextual polarity from two perspectives: the interaction of terms with their textual neighbourhood (local context) and text genre (global context). We introduce an approach to hybridise a general purpose lexicon, SentiWordNet, with genre-specific vocabulary and sentiment. Evaluation results from diverse social media show that our strategies to account for local and global contexts significantly improve sentiment classification, and are complementary in combination.

Identifying and analysing the content of posts sent to hospitals may provide a novel real-time measure of quality, supplementing traditional, survey-based approaches. Objective To assess the use of Twitter as a supplemental data stream for measuring patientperceived quality of care in US hospitals and compare patient sentiments about hospitals with established quality measures. Design 404 065 tweets directed to 2349 US hospitals over a 1-year period were classified as having to do with patient experience using a machine learning approach. Sentiment was calculated for these tweets using natural language processing. 11 602 tweets were manually categorised into patient experience topics. Finally, hospitals with ≥50 patient experience tweets were surveyed to understand how they use Twitter to interact with patients. Key results Roughly half of the hospitals in the US have a presence on Twitter. Of the tweets directed toward these hospitals, 34 725 (9.4%) were related to patient experience and covered diverse topics. Analyses limited to hospitals with ≥50 patient experience tweets revealed that they were more active on Twitter, more likely to be below the national median of Medicare patients (p<0.001) and above the national median for nurse/patient ratio (p=0.006), and to be a nonprofit hospital (p<0.001). After adjusting for hospital characteristics, we found that Twitter sentiment was not associated with Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) ratings (but having a Twitter account was), although there was a weak association with 30-day hospital readmission rates (p=0.003). Conclusions Tweets describing patient experiences in hospitals cover a wide range of patient care aspects and can be identified using automated approaches. These tweets represent a potentially untapped indicator of quality and may be valuable to patients, researchers, policy makers and hospital administrators.",,clinical article; consumer; day hospital; hospital administrator; hospital readmission; human; machine learning; medicare; natural language processing; non profit hospital; nurse patient ratio; patient care; scientist,2-s2.0-84969685725

The most common way for people to express their opinions, thoughts and communicate with each other is via written text. In this paper, we present a sentiment analysis system for automatic recognition of emotions in text, using an ensemble of classifiers. The designed ensemble classifier schema is based on the notion of combining knowledge-based and statistical machine learning classification methods aiming to benefit from their merits and minimize their drawbacks. The ensemble schema is based on three classifiers; two are statistical (a NaÃ¯ve Bayes and a Maximum Entropy learner) and the third one is a knowledge-based tool performing deep analysis of the natural language sentences. The knowledge-based tool analyzes the sentence's text structure and dependencies and implements a keyword-based approach, where the emotional state of a sentence is derived from the emotional affinity of the sentence's emotional parts. The ensemble classifier schema has been extensively evaluated on various forms of text such as, news headlines, articles and social media posts. The experimental results indicate quite satisfactory performance regarding the ability to recognize emotion presence in text and also to identify the polarity of the emotions. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It is widely recognized that phrasal information is crucial for sentiment classification. However, existing sentiment classification algorithms typically split a sentence as a word sequence, which does not effectively handle the inconsistent sentiment polarity between a phrase and the words it contains, such as {'not bad,' 'bad'} and {'a great deal of,' 'great'}. We address this issue by developing a joint framework for sentence-level sentiment classification. It simultaneously generates useful segmentations and predicts sentence-level polarity based on the segmentation results. Specifically, we develop a candidate generation model to produce segmentation candidates of a sentence; a segmentation ranking model to score the usefulness of a segmentation candidate for sentiment classification; and a classification model for predicting the sentiment polarity of a segmentation. We train the joint framework directly from sentences annotated with only sentiment polarity, without using any syntactic or sentiment annotations in segmentation level. We conduct experiments for sentiment classification on two benchmark datasets: a tweet dataset and a review dataset. Experimental results show that: 1) our method performs comparably with state-of-The-art methods on both datasets; 2) joint modeling segmentation and classification outperforms pipelined baseline methods in various experimental settings. © 2014 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; joint segmentation and classification; natural language processing; sentiment analysis; sentiment classification,Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Classification framework; Classification models; Joint segmentation; NAtural language processing; Segmentation results; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; State-of-the-art methods; Classification (of information),2-s2.0-84936797525

Identifying the sentiment present in them can be helpful for measuring the frame of mind of the public, their satisfaction with respect to a product, or their support of a social event. In this context, polarity classification is a subfield of sentiment analysis focused on determining whether the content of a text is objective or subjective, and in the latter case, if it conveys a positive or a negative opinion. Most polarity detection techniques tend to take into account individual terms in the text and even some degree of linguistic knowledge, but they do not usually consider syntactic relations between words. This article explores how relating lexical, syntactic, and psychometric information can be helpful to perform polarity classification on Spanish tweets. We provide an evaluation for both shallow and deep linguistic perspectives. Empirical results show an improved performance of syntactic approaches over pure lexical models when using large training sets to create a classifier, but this tendency is reversed when small training collections are used. © 2015 ASIS&T.",(activities and operations); (activities and operations); automatic classification; classification; computer operations; information operations; information processing; organization of information; text processing,Computational linguistics; Computer operating procedures; Data processing; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Syntactics; Text processing; (activities and operations); Automatic classification; Information operations; Linguistic knowledge; Organization of informations; Polarity classification; Sentiment analysis; Syntactic approach; Classification (of information),2-s2.0-84930394400

Issues that GLBTQ people organize around-bullying in the schools, hate crimes, marriage equality, fair housing and health care-aren't even noted in climate change discussions. Feminist analyses are well positioned to address these and other structural inequalities in climate crises, and to unmask the gendered character of first-world overconsumption; moreover, both feminist animal studies and posthumanism bring awareness of species as an unexamined dimension in climate change. A queer, posthumanist, ecological and feminist approach-brought together through the intersectional lens of ecofeminism-is needed to tackle the antifeminist threads companioning the scientific response to climate change: the linked rhetorics of population control, erotophobia and ecophobia, anti-immigration sentiment, and increased militarism. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,climate change; ecofeminism; environmentalism; ideology; international organization; womens status; Animalia,2-s2.0-84923304452

We compiled, mapped, and analyzed a set of 9,757 stories published over 16 months relevant to the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA), Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), and PROTECT IP Act (PIPA). This study applies a mixed-methods approach that combines text and link analysis with human coding and informal interviews to map the evolution of the controversy over time and to analyze the mobilization, roles, and interactions of various actors. We find a vibrant, diverse, and decentralized networked public sphere that exhibited broad participation, leveraged topical expertise, and successfully reframed a debate and focused public sentiment to shape national public policy. A network of small-scale commercial tech media, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and individuals fulfilled the fourth estate function; traditional media then amplified the work of these actors. The campaign involved substantial experimentation and rapid development of mobilization strategies. We observe an increased public awareness of an agenda originating in the networked public sphere, which emerged successfully despite substantial expenditures attempting to produce a mass media narrative that favored the legislation. Moreover, we witness what we call an attention backbone, in which more trafficked sites amplify less-visible individual voices on specific subjects. The data suggest that, at least in this case, the networked public sphere enabled a dynamic public discourse that involved both individual and organizational participants and offered substantive discussion of complex issues contributing to affirmative political action.

To solve this problem an automated opinion mining approach is needed. This task of automatic opinion mining can be done mainly at three different levels, which are document level, sentence level and aspect level. Most of the previous work is in the field of document or sentence level opinion mining. This paper focus on aspect level opinion mining and propose a new syntactic based approach for it, which uses syntactic dependency, aggregate score of opinion words, SentiWordNet and aspect table together for opinion mining. The experimental work was done on restaurant reviews. The dataset of restaurant reviews was collected from web and tagged manually. The proposed method achieved total accuracy of 78.04% on the annotated test set.

In real applications, these users generated sentiment data can span so many different domains that it is difficult to manually label training data for all of them. In this article, we develop a general solution to cross-domain sentiment classification when we do not have any labeled data in a target domain but have some labeled data in a source domain. To bridge the gap between domains, we propose a novel algorithm, called topical correspondence transfer (TCT). This is achieved by learning the domain-specific information from different domains into unified topics, with the help of shared topics across all domains. In this way, the topical correspondences behind the shared topics can be used as a bridge to reduce the gap between domains. We conduct experiments on a benchmark composed of reviews of 4 types of Amazon products.

To capture the mixture of sentiment and topics simultaneously in reviews is still a challenging task. In this paper, we present a novel probabilistic model framework based on the non-parametric hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) topic model, called non-parametric joint sentiment topic mixture model (NJST), which adds a sentiment level to the HDP topic model and detects sentiment and topics simultaneously from reviews. Then considered the dynamic nature of social media data, we propose dynamic NJST (dNJST) which adds time decay dependencies of historical epochs to the current epochs. Compared with the existing sentiment topic mixture models which are based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), the biggest difference of NJST and dNJST is that they can determine topic number automatically. We implement NJST and dNJST with online variational inference algorithms, and incorporate the sentiment priors of words into NJST and dNJST with HowNet lexicon. The experiment results in some Chinese social media dataset show that dNJST can effectively detect and track dynamic sentiment and topics. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The first approach adopted in this study was calculating the important descriptive statistics of MOOC-related tweets and examining the daily, weekly, and monthly trends of MOOC that appeared on Twitter. This information can enable MOOC practitioners to observe participants' temporal activities on social media and ascertain the most effective time to post or analyze tweets. Secondly, we investigated how public sentiment toward MOOC learning can be assessed according to related tweets. Because the availability and popularity of opinion-rich social networking services are increasing for MOOC communities, our findings from the sentiment analysis of Twitter data can afford substantial insights into participant perceptions of MOOC learning. Third, we analyzed the positive and negative retweets related to MOOCs and identified the influencers of these retweets. Social network diagrams were also developed to reveal how sentimental messages about MOOCs on Twitter were disseminated from the top influencers with the highest number of positive/negative retweets about MOOCs. Analyzing the relationships among top retweet users is vital to MOOC practitioners because they can use this information to filter or recommend MOOC-related messages to the influencers.

The article analyses the cascade of events that led to a moment of political and economic crisis in mid-2011, with special focus on how a 2009 sodomy case made homophobia available as a new genre of social commentary. Employing discourse analysis of newspaper articles, political speeches, the proceedings of a sodomy case, and discussions about men who have sex with men (MSM) as an HIV risk group, I show how African homophobia takes form via interested deployments of 'cultural' rhetoric toward competing ends.

The feasibility of attaining a reliable classifier for the task of interest is embarked by some in transfer learning, where label information from relevant source domains is considered for complimenting the design process. The core challenge arising from such endeavors, however, is the induction of source sample selection bias, such that the trained classifier has the tendency of steering toward the distribution of the source domain. In addition, this bias is deemed to become more severe on data involving multiple classes. Considering this cue, our interest in this paper is to address such a challenge in the target domain, where ordinal labeled data are unavailable. In contrast to the previous works, we propose a transfer ordinal label learning paradigm to predict the ordinal labels of target unlabeled data by spanning the feasible solution space with ensemble of ordinal classifiers from the multiple relevant source domains. Specifically, the maximum margin criterion is considered here for the construction of the target classifier from an ensemble of source ordinal classifiers. Theoretical analysis and extensive empirical studies on real-world data sets are presented to study the benefits of the proposed method. © 2012 IEEE.",Classifier selection; domain adaptation; ordinal regression; sentiment analysis; source sample selection bias; transfer learning,Classifier selection; Domain adaptation; Ordinal regression; Sample selection bias; Sentiment analysis; Transfer learning; Artificial intelligence; Computer networks; Virtual reality,2-s2.0-84886952451

Sentiment analysis of product reviews has recently become very popular in Web text mining, natural language processing and computational linguistics research. Automated analysis of the sentiments presented in online consumer feedbacks can facilitate both organizations' business strategy development and individual consumers' comparison shopping. The main contribution of this paper is the illustration of a novel feature-level sentiment analysis mechanism which is underpinned by a fuzzy domain sentiment ontology tree extraction algorithm. The proposed mechanism can automatically construct fuzzy domain ontology tree (FDSOT) based on the product reviews, including the extraction of sentiment words, product features and the relations among features. Here product features (or features) mean product components and attributes. Evaluated based on Chinese product reviews collected from 360buy.com, the experiments show that our research approach improves the accuracy of polarity predictions. © 2012 IEEE.",domain ontology; fuzzy sets; ontology learning; opinion mining; sentiment analysis,Comparison shopping; Domain ontologies; Fuzzy domain ontology; NAtural language processing; Ontology learning; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Text classification; Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Forestry; Fuzzy sets; Natural language processing systems; Signal processing; Data mining; Classification; Data Processing; Forestry; Information Retrieval; Set,2-s2.0-84875038745

The emergence of new systems and services has created a number of novel social and ubiquitous environments for mining information, data, and, finally, knowledge. This connects but also transcends private and business applications featuring a range of different types of networks and organizational contexts. Important structures concern subgroups emerging in those applications as communities (connecting people), roles and key actors in the networks and communities, and opinions, beliefs, and sentiments of the set of actors. Collective intelligence can then be considered as an emerging phenomenon of the different interactions. This focus article considers mining approaches concerning social media in social networks and organizations and the analysis of such data. We first summarize important terms and concepts. Next, we describe and discuss key actor identification and characterization, sentiment mining and analysis, and community mining. In the sequel we consider different application areas and briefly discuss two exemplary ubiquitous and social applications-the social conference guidance system Conferator, and the MyGroup system for supporting working groups. Furthermore, we describe the VIKAMINE system for mining communities and subgroups in socialmedia in the sketched application domains. Finally, we conclude with a discussion and outlook.© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,Application area; Business applications; Collective intelligences; Community mining; Guidance system; Key Actors; Mining communities; Organizational context; Social media; Social Networks; Ubiquitous environments; Working groups; Social aspects; Social networking (online),2-s2.0-84873201905

Several interesting and advanced works were performed on English. In contrast, very few works were conducted on Arabic. This paper presents the study we have carried out to investigate supervised sentiment classification in an Arabic context. We use two Arabic Corpora which are different in many aspects. We use three common classifiers known by their effectiveness, namely Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines and k-Nearest Neighbor. We investigate some settings to identify those that allow achieving the best results. These settings are about stemming type, term frequency thresholding, term weighting and n-gram words. We show that Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machines are competitively effective; however k- Nearest Neighbor's effectiveness depends on the corpus. Through this study, we recommend to use light-stemming rather than stemming, to remove terms that occur once, to combine unigram and bigram words and to use presence-based weighting rather than frequency-based one. Our results show also that classification performance may be influenced by documents length, documents homogeneity and the nature of document authors. However, the size of data sets does not have an impact on classification results. © Springer-Verlag London 2012.",,Classification performance; Classification results; K-nearest neighbors; Nearest neighbors; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Term Frequency; Term weighting; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Information retrieval systems; Support vector machines; Text processing,2-s2.0-84881507047

As part of the rise of green liberalism, it is argued that recreational activism - recreational activities that are backed by a public political campaign - works (often accidentally) to legitimise neoliberalisation in the realm of environmental politics. Drawing from two expressions of recreational activism, a wilderness campaign in Canada and the work of Patagonia™ on environmental issues, this paper illustrates how these initiatives not only pair together a concern for how one acts within wilderness with the political choices outside of wilderness areas, but also reify the market value of environmental protection. The individualized nature of these political expressions, paradoxically, stems from both the counter-culture initiatives of the 1960s and the neoliberal reforms of the past 30 years. As moments of recreational consumption these campaigns promote a conservative economic agenda whose consequences will likely override the progressive political sentiments embodied by these activities. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",environmental activism; green consumption; neoliberalism; outdoor recreation; Patagonia,environmental politics; environmental protection; liberalism; neoliberalism; recreational activity; wilderness area; Patagonia,2-s2.0-84858142971

However, since the early 1990s significant anti-American sentiments have started to emerge in China. Such a dramatic shift in Chinese people's attitudes toward the U.S. has significant implications for both U.S. domestic politics and foreign policies. Many politicians, journalists, and scholars have identified the increasing reliance of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on nationalism for mobilizing political support, as well as its still firm control over the domestic mass media for propaganda campaigns, as critical factors driving this dramatic public opinion shift. Nevertheless, without systematic and appropriate empirical evidence, it is extremely difficult to adjudicate the validity of speculations on why such a change occurred. Taking advantage of a 2005 two-city survey in China with pertinent survey instruments, we (a) explored Chinese urban residents' usage of different media sources, (b) examined the dimensionality of their evaluations of the U.S., and (c) scrutinized the impacts of Chinese urbanites' usage of diversified media sources on their perceptions of the U.S. The findings show that people's attitudes toward U.S. foreign policies can be clearly distinguished from their evaluations of American political institutions and socioeconomic achievements. Most importantly, our analyses also reveal that, embedded as they are in China's partially transformed and partially diversified media environment, Chinese urban residents do not become pro-American (or vice versa) from the usage of alternative media sources beyond the CCP's control. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",China media sources; Public opinion; Views of America,,2-s2.0-79961162360

We follow this line of work while focusing on the domain of user-generated product reviews, a main field of application for sentiment analysis.

Tree kernels alleviate the complexity of feature selection and generate effective features to satisfy the special requirements in opinion mining. In this paper, we define several tree kernels for sentiment expression extraction and sentiment classification, which are subtasks of opinion mining. Our proposed tree kernels encode not only syntactic structure information, but also sentiment related information, such as sentiment boundary and sentiment polarity, which are important features to opinion mining. Experimental results on a benchmark data set indicate that tree kernels can significantly improve the performance of both sentiment expression extraction and sentiment classification.

Design/methodology/approach - A collection of movie review documents was harvested from the four types of web sources, and a sample of 520 movie reviews were analysed to compare the content and textual characteristics across the four genres. The analysis focused on document and sentence length, part-of-speech distribution, vocabulary, aspects of movies discussed, star ratings used and multimedia content in the reviews. The study also identified frequently occurring positive and negative terms in the different genres, as well as the pattern of responses in discussion threads. Findings - Critic reviews and blog postings are longer than user reviews and discussion threads, and contain longer sentences. Critic reviews and blogs contain more nouns and prepositions, whereas discussion board and user reviews have more verbs and adverbs. Critic reviews have the largest vocabulary and also the highest proportion of unique terms not found in the other genres. The most informative sentiment words in each genre are provided in the paper. With regard to content, critic reviews are more comprehensive in coverage, and discuss the movie director much more often than the other genres. User reviews discuss the scene aspects (including action and visual effects) more often than the other genres, while blogs tend to talk about the cast, and discuss the music and sound slightly more often. Research limitations/implications - The study only analysed movie review documents. Similar content and text analysis studies can be carried out in other domains, such as commercial product reviews, celebrity reviews, company reviews and political opinions to compare the results. Originality/value - The main contribution of the study is the sentiment content analysis results across genres, which show the similarities and differences in content and textual characteristics in the four online opinion genres. The insights will be useful in designing automatic sentiment summarisation methods for multiple online genres. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Attitudes Paper type Research paper; Film; Internet,Blog postings; Commercial products; Content analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Discussion boards; Multimedia contents; Negative term; On-line opinions; Paper-type; Part Of Speech; Research papers; Sentence length; Similarities and differences; Text analysis; Visual effects; Web sources; Blogs; Internet; Paper products; Research; Visual communication; Motion pictures,2-s2.0-77953732924

Freud's techniques of condensation and displacement and Gramsci's account of hegemony will be the analytical tools for the satirical discourse and its counter-hegemonic project to the fascist ideological ascendance. Both tools will facilitate my analysis of political satire as a discourse expressing revolutionary sentiments and occupying a middle space between the dominant ideology and the discourse that resists it. In order to understand this space, which is not anti-hegemonic but counter-hegemonic, we should look at the language of the dominant discourse and how this is used by political satire. Having in mind the particular role of censorship and the constraints it poses to the satirical discourse, I will discuss three empirical sections in relation to the ascent of Fascism: the role of power, the political consensus and the political practices. © Walter de Gruyter 2008.",Censorship; Counter-hegemony; Italian fascism; Political satire,,2-s2.0-39649105667

Learning consists of formulating the order preferences as additional regularization in a risk minimization framework. We define a linear program to effectively solve the optimization problem.

Many studies also have asserted that shame is best understood in terms of its assumed opposite, honor, for example, as represented in so-called 'honor/shame' complexes of certain regions such as the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Critical responses to these studies have included efforts to represent more balanced, multiple voices and perspectives concerning shame and related sentiments: for example, emphasis of women's viewpoints and more transcultural contexts. Mirdal's article contributes to these efforts. This commentary discusses some challenges of placing shame in wider contexts of broader concerns in cultural theory, moving toward more nuanced, processual and dynamic portrayals of cultural and social practices. Shame needs to be analyzed in terms of both intimate and subjective sentiments, on the one hand, and politics and domination, on the other. More nuanced analysis yields insights into modernity, thereby detaching analysis of shame from some previous tendencies to associate this sentiment solely with tradition and the past. This commentary also argues, however, that there remain semantic and pragmatic problems of intentionality and agency. Fundamental to understanding shame, therefore, is detailed analysis of its nuanced meanings, as well as its effects in different social encounters.

In particular, it tests the presence of over-optimism when pricing IPOs on the Italian Nuovo Mercato. Design/methodology/approach – The paper investigates whether the analysts make systematic errors when forecasting the performance of the firm undergoing the IPO by comparing analysts’ ex-ante expectations to actual ex-post figures. Using a sample of pre-IPO analysts’ reports, the paper performs a regression analysis using the forecast errors (FE) of post-issue sales as dependent variable in order to find out the determinants of mis-valuation. Findings – It is found that the Nuovo Mercato has been essentially a “market for projects” in which young enterprises endowed with a few tangible assets sold their business plans to the market exploiting high-growth opportunities. In the aftermarket, stock and operating performances are found to be declining, falling short of initial expectations. The extent of the actual post-issue growth was lower than the ex-ante estimations by financial analysts, whose valuations were systematically upwardly biased. Affiliated analysts are found not to be more over-optimistic than the unaffiliated. FE appear to be primarily driven by the extent of forecasted growth, by market sentiment and (inversely) by the size of the firm. Originality/value – From the perspective of investors, this study contributes to the understanding of the helpfulness and limits of the analysts’ forecasts in investment decisions and, more generally, of the determinants of over-optimism. This study addresses the issue of over-optimism and provides empirical evidence of it.

One prevention strategy promoted for sexually active adolescents is condom use: therefore, influences on correct and consistent condom use are worth examining. Because interventions and observational research into predicting and increasing condom use have yielded mixed results, we hypothesized that a theoretically driven model incorporating female adolescents' perceptions about partner sentiments along with their own perceptions, intentions, and behaviours would improve condom use predictions. We also measured condom use errors and consistency for a more precise estimate of effective use than is common in the literature. In three structural equation models tested on a sample of 519 female adolescents, we found that intentions were associated with both correct and consistent condom use; that females' expectancy beliefs about condom use were associated with intentions; and that females' expectancy beliefs about partners' sentiments reduced the impact of their expectancy beliefs about condom use. The implications of these relations upon condom use correctness and consistency are discussed with respect to informing interventions, among other future research. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.",Adolescents; Condom attitude; Sexually transmitted infection,adolescent; adult; analytical error; article; attitude to health; attitude to sexuality; condom; demography; female; human; infection prevention; male; prediction; priority journal; sample size; sex difference; sexually transmitted disease; statistical analysis; theoretical model; Adolescent; Adult; Attitude; Condoms; Female; Georgia; Humans; Interviews; Interviews as Topic; Sexual Partners,2-s2.0-33749326904

Here, specific cultural practices unfamiliar to most risk professionals carry significant inherent risks in the eyes of those professionals but not necessarily in the eyes of practitioners. Practitioners' past experience and history as targets of religious suppression and anti-immigrant sentiment create a reluctance to engage with researchers or public health officials in risk assessment or preventive risk communication efforts. The potential for the risk - in this case mercury contamination in dwellings - to extend beyond the practicing community to future occupants adds to public health concern. Understanding the risks of these practices requires both an understanding of the cultural and political context, beliefs, and behaviors of mercury users and an understanding of the fate and transport of mercury in typical use scenarios. In this study, we employed ethnographic methods (interviews and participant observation) to understand beliefs and behavior about mercury use as well as quantitative modeling and measurement to estimate and assess potential exposures. This represents a new methodology tailored to situations in which traditional activities or observances that are integral components of cultural identity pose risks in and of themselves. Our findings indicate that there are different types of mercury use stemming from different cultural and religious traditions that result in different levels of exposure. Many of the mercury uses that can result in the highest exposures to mercury vapors have previously been attributed to the religious tradition of Santeria, but appear instead to have their roots outside of the religion. © 2006 Society for Risk Analysis.",Culture; Ethnography; Exposure assessment; Mercury; Risk communication,"Ethnography; Exposure assessment; Preventive risk communication efforts; Risk communication; Health risks; Industrial management; Mercury (metal); Public relations; Risk management; Safety factor; Risk assessment; communication; cultural tradition; ethnicity; Latino people; mercury (element); pollution exposure; public health; religion; risk assessment; article; Caribbean Islands; clinical article; cultural factor; environmental exposure; ethnography; female; Hispanic; human; interpersonal communication; interview; male; mercurialism; observation; occupational exposure; religion; risk assessment; risk factor; Caribbean Region; Ceremonial Behavior; Culture; Environmental Exposure; Female; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Interviews; Interviews as Topic; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Mercury; Mercury Compounds; Public Health; Risk; Risk Assessment",2-s2.0-33750195221

Type of study: auto quest, having opened and half-opened questions concerning four chapters:. • identifying the subject;. • identifying his/her conjoint;. • conjugal life (criteria of the partner choice, sentiments towards the partner, confidence degree to the partner, similarity's degree between them, practice of some activities without the partner, negotiation of conjugal problems, expression of intimate subjects to the partner, existence, or not of couple conflicts);. • sexual life (quality of sexual desire to the partner, degree of sexual satisfaction, factors influencing quality of conjugal sexual desire, sexual difficulties for the patient and/or his (her) partner). Results. - Rate of response: 24% (120 validated responses from 500 distributed questioners). • Epidemiological profile of our subjects: They were male in 64% of cases, with a mean age of 38.9 years (women were younger then men). It was the first marriage, for 96% of the subjects. Length of marriage was 11.5 years (from one to 29 years). Ninety percent of subjects had from 1 to 4 children, and 75% were using a method of contraception. • Epidemiological profile of the partner: Partner had a mean age of 36.5 years. Conjoint had common characters with our propositus of inquiry in 75% of cases, and opposed characters with them in 6.7% of cases. • Relational and affective aspects in couple:. a) preferences for an ideal profile of the future partner: valuable for 96% of our subjects; b) concord degree of the partner with these preferences: valuable for 93% of answers;. c) sentiments of the subject towards his (her) partner: positive for 72%;. d) confidence degree to the conjoint: great confidence for 81.2%;. e) partner character: some degree of similarity for 77.5%. Opposed character for 6.7%;. f) distance (practice of some activities without the partner): men had separated activities more than women (69.5% to 51.5%);. g) couple communication: present at 71% of couples;. h) intimacy: present at 51% of our subjects (women, especially), and absent at 19% (men, especially);. i) conflicts with the partner: occasionally present at 72%;. j) couple's stability: present at 86.7%. • Conjugal sexuality: Conjugal sexual desire is good or very good in 76.5% of cases and conjugal sexual satisfaction is usually or often present for 80%. • Factors Interfering with the sexual desire:. Factors favouring the maintain of sexual desire in couple: positive sentiments, confidence, intimacy and communication seem favouring the sexual desire for both sexes. Sexual desire of men seems maintained by sexual satisfaction and sexual desire of women by couple stability and length of marriage. Factors without interference with the sexual conjugal desire: distance, attraction and concord of characters seem without interference with the sexual conjugal desire. Sexual desire of men seems not altered by conjugal conflicts. This can be attached to a traditional and cultural view, which valorises the familial cell, more than the personal data. Discussion. - Analyses of our results have permitted to know some particularities comparing to the occident literature data. We have, then, distinguished two groups of factors interfering with the sexual desire: factors converging with the occidental literature and proper factors to our series:. Convergent factors with occidental data:. 1- positive sentiments, confidence, intimacy and communication seem to favor sexual conjugal desire. 2- sexual satisfaction favors the conjugal sexual desire, in our series. Our results concerning sexual satisfaction, concord with other studies in Tunisia and the Occident. Couple's stability seems, being, in our series, an important factor for maintaining sexual desire, especially for women. 3- sexual difficulties: sexual difficulties, for the subject or his (her) partner seem altering the sexual desire, especially for women. Divergent factors with occidental data:. 1- distance: unlike the occidental data, couples, in our series seem to have a ""symbiotic"" mode of operation. 2- conjugal conflicts: in our series, conflicts didn't have harmful impact on the male sexual desire. This may be attached to a sense of responsibility, for preserving the integrity of the family. 3- marriage length: we have noted, for women, a favourable evolution of the sexual desire, with the duration of marriage. With the time, inhibition seems decreasing, women gests used to the sexual life, and by consequence, a better sexuality, with no culpability. 4- attraction and partner's character: we didn't note a narrow correlation between those factors and the sexual desire. This can be attached to a resignation from the social reality. Divergences of some of our data from occidental data evoke difference of context, of personalities and of view of the sexuality, between the two cultures. Our difference with Occidental data evoque differences of personality, of community-view of the sexual life in general, which coincide largely; in our context; with conjugal sexuality. Our study reaffirms, an old reality, of the necessity of transcultural view, in studying sexual life of couple. © 2005.",Conjugal couple; Maghrebic context; Sexual desire; Sexuality,adult; article; comparative study; conflict; contraception; controlled study; cultural factor; descriptive research; female; human; intimacy; male; marriage; questionnaire; sexual behavior; sexual satisfaction; Tunisia,2-s2.0-33745936545

While Nader's place in history is unique due to his impact on the election's outcome, Nader's campaign follows in a long tradition of significant third party candidacies in the twentieth century. We explore the 2000 Nader campaign with the goal of placing its appeals - as well as its effect on voters - within this broader context of recent third party candidacies for the presidency. Based on the nature of his issue appeals, we can characterize the Nader campaign as a blend of left-wing populism and anti-system sentiment. Noting the similarity of this appeal with those of other significant third party candidates (excepting Wallace in 1968), we go on to look at the electoral impact of Nader and these other candidates. Our analysis of state-wide voting patterns yields surprisingly large correlations between the Nader vote and votes for recent third party campaigns that were ideologically different from the Green Party campaign. Moving to individual-level analysis, we find that third party voting is driven largely by alienation from the major parties and the political system as well as identification with third parties. As a result, we find that Democrats in 2000 were unlikely to defect from Al Gore, suggesting that people who did vote for Nader did so because of their repulsion from the major parties or attraction to Nader and/or the Green Party.

While much contemporary debate has focussed on the excesses of executive remuneration at the ""big end of town"", what is not so prominent are the views of unions representing employees at the other end of the remuneration spectrum: this is the purpose of this paper. Design/methodology/approach - Evidence was gathered at two levels using two sets of research instruments: in-depth interviews with senior union officials, and primary documentation analysis with specific reference to performance appraisal and performance-related pay clauses in union Enterprise Bargaining Agreements. Findings - Document analysis reveals that performance appraisal and performance-related pay clauses range from mere stipulation of existence to detailed processes and principles of design and implementation. Specific clauses in the white-collar unions' agreements suggest that they are not totally opposed. However, the lack of performance appraisal and performance-related pay clauses in the blue-collar unions' agreements illustrate their propensity to restrict pay increases to a job classification structure. Although there were clauses that aimed to ensure a performance-oriented culture, their agreements seem to be mere sentiments. Overall, only one union supports the notion of performance related pay; the others find performance appraisals difficult to embrace. Negative experiences and consequent problems lead them to argue that the process is complicated and usually puts workers at a disadvantage. Originality/value - Strands of different explanations account for union opposition, but the principal issue is that performance appraisal has only an evaluative function, that is to link performance to pay. To minimise problems in shaping PRP schemes, the unions advocated the integration of a social dimension; transparency and equality. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Australia; Performance appraisal; Performance related pay; Trade unions,,2-s2.0-18844428345

This paper provides an overview of research conducted from within these traditions to explain union-related phenomena and identifies some of the limitations that arise as a consequence of a shared tendency to treat people in an atomistic fashion. The paper argues for an understanding of the psychological processes that underpin group-based action. To this end, it elaborates a theoretical framework based on social identity theory and self-categorisation theory that would allow us to examine the dynamic interplay between the individual, their cognitions and their environment.

The main aim of this article is to fill in this gap to some extent by examining the main factors determining the emergence of armed religious and ethnic groups in this country. The basic conclusion to emerge from the analysis is that, although such factors as the closure of the country's political space, state repression, and the growth of atavistic sentiments remain important in explaining Algeria's religious and ethnic violence, economic collapse, religious spending, and diversionary politics are variables that should not be ignored when addressing the sources and sustainability of such violence. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,2-s2.0-84937378062

HTS cables are viable alternatives in areas were space considerations are extremely costly or where overhead lines can not be built due to public concern and sentiment. This paper presents the results of a power system study conducted on the Detroit Edison transmission system, which compares load flow impacts of HTS cables in a meshed transmission network. In this study, a new 120kV link was applied to an existing system to solve future load growth expectations. A comparison of alternative technologies was also conducted and evaluated versus the effects of the introduction of a HTS cable. Two methods of alternative reinforcements were created, one focused on using the same circuit paths and space occupancy, the other compared circuits with the same overall capability excluding space constraints, both methodologies were evaluated in terms of system power flow impacts along with impacts in short circuit current levels. Through variations in load, and generation dispatch patterns the reliability impact of the cable was evaluated using N-1, and N-2 (line and generator outage) simulation.

This period was purposefully chosen because it represents a ""natural"" experiment concerning the impact of continuous increases in the rate of incarceration on crime rates. A second analysis examining cross-sectional, state level data for the period 1980-1991 is also presented.

Besides the well-understood phenomenon of short-sighted, self-interested agents performing well in the short-term but ruining their chances of such performance in the long run in a world of reciprocators, the results suggest that, where some agents are more generous than that, these agents have a positive impact on the social group to which they belong, without compromising too much their individual performance (i.e., the group performance improves). The inspiration for this project comes from a discussion on Moral Sentiments by M. Ridley. We describe various simulations where conditions and parameters over determined dimensions were arranged to account for different types and compositions of societies. Further, we indicate several lessons that arise from the analysis of the results and comparison of the different experiments. We also relate this work to our previous anthropological approach to the adaptation of migrant agents, and argue that allowing agents to possess suitably-chosen emotions can have a decisive impact on Multi-Agent Systems.

Latent class models are used to analyze a set of six scenarios regarding approval/disapproval of legalized abortion; we find substantial similarity in the structure of the two publics' opinions; Catholics in Poland and the USA appear to either (1) disapprove of all six reasons for legal abortion, (2) approve of all six reasons for legal abortion, or (3) adopt an intermediate position in which they approve of the three ethical/medical reasons for abortion, but disapprove of the three social reasons for abortion. Interestingly, we find no difference in the relative proportions of American and Polish Catholics who disapprove of ethical/medical reasons for abortion (a relatively small minority in each population), but Polish Catholics are much more likely than American Catholics to have 'made the break' from the Church's teachings; that is, to have adopted a position in direct opposition to the Church, one which approves of abortion for social reasons. Moreover, there appears to have been a significant increase in this approval between 1992 and 1993; possibly a result of the central role of this issue in the political debate of contemporary Poland.

In a regression model, measures of the number of engineers employed by a department, the number of attending staff, and the number of training lectures given by engineers were found to be most highly associated with dollar value of grant support. The average level of research resources available at responding institutions was generally low, despite a seemingly strong desire to do quality research.

As a consequence, many of the state-of-the-art algorithms are domain dependent as they require a labeled training corpus to learn the domain features. This requires the availability of labeled corpora which is a cumbersome task in itself. However, for text sentiment detection SentiWordNet (SWN) may be used. It is a vocabulary where terms are arranged in synonym groups called synsets. This research makes use of SentiWordNet and treats it as the labeled corpus for training. A sentiment dictionary, SentiMI, builds upon the mutual information calculated from these terms. A complete framework is developed by using feature selection and extracting mutual information, from SentiMI, for the selected features. Training, testing and evaluation of the proposed framework are conducted on a large dataset of 50,000 movie reviews.

A fundamental problem in this method is Truth Inference, which decides how to effectively infer the truth. Recently, the database community and data mining community independently study this problem and propose various algorithms. However, these algorithms are not compared extensively under the same framework and it is hard for practitioners to select appropriate algorithms. To alleviate this problem, we provide a detailed survey on 17 existing algorithms and perform a comprehensive evaluation using 5 real datasets.

We present a framework where methods and tools from a set of disciplines, ranging from Semantic and Social Web to Natural Language Processing, provide us the building blocks for creating a semantic social space to organize artworks according to an ontology of emotions. The ontology is inspired by the Plutchik's circumplex model, a well-founded psychological model of human emotions. Users can be involved in the creation of the emotional space, through a graphical interactive interface. The development of such semantic space enables new ways of accessing and exploring art collections. The affective categorization model and the emotion detection output are encoded into W3C ontology languages.

Most of these studies reuse existing sentiment analysis tools such as SentiStrength and NLTK. However, these tools have been trained on product reviews and movie reviews and, therefore, their results might not be applicable in the software engineering domain. In this paper we study whether the sentiment analysis tools agree with the sentiment recognized by human evaluators (as reported in an earlier study) as well as with each other. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of the choice of a sentiment analysis tool on software engineering studies by conducting a simple study of differences in issue resolution times for positive, negative and neutral texts. We repeat the study for seven datasets (issue trackers and Stack Overflow questions) and different sentiment analysis tools and observe that the disagreement between the tools can lead to contradictory conclusions. © 2015 IEEE.",Androids; Humanoid robots; Labeling; Manuals; Sentiment analysis; Software; Software engineering,Anthropomorphic robots; Computer software; Data mining; Labeling; Social aspects; Software engineering; Androids; Humanoid robot; Issue resolutions; Manuals; Product reviews; Sentiment analysis; Software developer; Software engineering domain; Computer software maintenance,2-s2.0-84961621698

Recently, sentiment analysis of Arabic user-generated content is increasingly viewed as an important research field. However, the majority of available approaches target the overall polarity of the text. To the best of our knowledge, there is no available research on aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) of Arabic text. This can be explained due to the lack of publically available datasets prepared for ABSA, and to the slow progress in sentiment analysis of Arabic text research in general. This paper fosters the domain of Arabic ABSA, and provides a benchmark human annotated Arabic dataset (HAAD). HAAD consists of books reviews in Arabic which have been annotated by humans with aspect terms and their polarities.

As consumption shifts from old media to new, Twitter has become a valuable resource for analyzing current events and headline news. In this research, we analyze tweets containing the word ""climate"" collected between September 2008 and July 2014. Through use of a previously developed sentiment measurement tool called the Hedonometer, we determine how collective sentiment varies in response to climate change news, events, and natural disasters. We find that natural disasters, climate bills, and oildrilling can contribute to a decrease in happiness while climate rallies, a book release, and a green ideas contest can contribute to an increase in happiness.

In order to enhance the performance of sentiment classification, ensemble methods have been investigated by previous research and proven to be effective theoretically and empirically. We advance this line of research by proposing an enhanced Random Subspace method, POS-RS, for sentiment classification based on part-of-speech analysis. Unlike existing Random Subspace methods using a single subspace rate to control the diversity of base learners, POS-RS employs two important parameters, i.e. content lexicon subspace rate and function lexicon subspace rate, to control the balance between the accuracy and diversity of base learners. Ten publicly available sentiment datasets were investigated to verify the effectiveness of proposed method. Empirical results reveal that POS-RS achieves the best performance through reducing bias and variance simultaneously compared to the base learner, i.e.; Support Vector Machine. These results illustrate that POS-RS can be used as a viable method for sentiment classification and has the potential of being successfully applied to other text classification problems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Because liberalism is associated with individualism, it is often assumed that firms will engage in mostly symbolic rather than substantive social and environmental actions; in other words, they will practice “greenwashing.” To understand how cultural beliefs in the virtues of liberalism affect the likelihood of greenwashing, we disentangle the effects of the distinct and co-existing beliefs in the virtues of economic liberalism. We begin by conducting an exploratory qualitative analysis of managers’ sentiments on this matter, based on a focus group methodology. We then use these investigative elements to articulate a comparison of the conflicting theoretical arguments: in liberal contexts, are firms, as social entities, inherently selfish or pro-active when it comes to CSA? We empirically test our hypotheses on a large-scale dataset. Finally, we show paradoxically that in countries where beliefs in the virtues of competition are strong, firms are more likely to greenwash, while in countries where beliefs in the virtues of individual responsibility are prominent, firms are more likely to focus on concrete actions. These findings suggest that in contexts where weak governments are seen as ideal, firms might feel the need to step into fill institutional voids, in contexts in which competitive mindsets dominate, this tendency is counterbalanced. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Competition; Corporate social actions; Country-level institutions; Economic liberalism; Greenwashing; Individual responsibility,,2-s2.0-84894236601

Thus, we extend the significant advances in text-based sentiment prediction tasks to the higherlevel challenge of predicting the underlying sentiments behind the images. We show that neither visual features nor the textual features are by themselves sufficient for accurate sentiment labeling. Thus, we provide a way of using both of them. We leverage the low-level visual features and mid-level attributes of an image, and formulate sentiment prediction problem as a non-negative matrix tri-factorization framework, which has the flexibility to incorporate multiple modalities of information and the capability to learn from heterogeneous features jointly.

Such expressions are written in an unstructured way using natural languages. They hold a great deal of knowledge about the user's opinions and reactions on various subjects. As a result, a new field called Sentiment Analysis (SA) has come into existence to address the complicated task of extracting such opinions or sentiments from the massive pool of unstructured text available online. Traditional works on SA consider only two sentiments: positive and negative. Multi-way SA sentiment analysis consider sentiments expressed using a star or ranking system. E.g., in a 5-star ranking system, the user's opinion ranges from very negative (1 star) to very positive (5 stars). This version of SA is obviously much harder to handle which partly explains the limited number of works on it. Moreover, we focus in this work on the Arabic language, which is largely understudied compared to the English language. In this work, a new and relatively large Arabic dataset is used. The dataset, called the Large Arabic Book Reviews (LABR) dataset, is gathered from an online book reviews website. The objective of this work is to perform baseline experiments on this dataset by applying the Bag-Of-Words words coupled with the most popular classifiers. We also investigate the effect of stemming and balancing the dataset.

In the case of elections, Twitter has been used actively by candidates and voters alike in a diverse range of elections around the world including the 2010 UK elections, the 2012 US presidential elections, and the 2013 Italian elections. However, Twitter has often been found to be a poor predictor of electoral success. This article investigates what role tweets play during elections and whether they are more reactive than predictive. Using the specific case of the 2012 US Republican presidential primary elections, this article explores how candidate's Twitter presence affects electoral outcomes and whether the sentiment and frequency of candidate-related tweets is related to campaign success and offline success at the ballot box. This study finds that tweets were more reactive rather than predictive. Additionally, sentiment analysis revealed that tweets were generally neutral towards candidates. An interesting finding of our study is how candidates used Twitter to generate ‘buzz’, political capital that did not translate to success at the ballot box. We specifically explore how Huntsman's daughters used YouTube videos and tweets that were perceived as a ‘backstage’ look into the campaign and ultimately generated high levels of buzz. Though tweets do not seem to be reflective or predictive of an election campaign offline, they are being used for social media campaigns which can and do get covered by traditional media. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",buzz; elections; political sentiment; Republican; social media; social media strategy; Twitter,,2-s2.0-84926256277

Sentiment analysis deals with extracting opinionated phrases from reviews, comments or tweets. i.e. to decide whether a given review or comment is positive, negative or neutral. Sentiment analysis has many applications and is very vital for many organizations. In this article, we utilize machine learning techniques to determine the polarity of tweets written in Arabic with the presence of dialects. Dialectical Arabic is abundantly present in social media and micro blogging channels. Dialectical Arabic presents challenges for topical classifications and for sentiment analysis. One example of such challenges is that stemming algorithms do not perform well with dialectical words. Another example is that dialectical Arabic uses an extended set of stopwords. In this research we introduce a framework that is capable of performing sentiment analysis on tweets written using either Modern Standard Arabic or Jordanian dialectical Arabic. The core of this framework is a dialect lexicon which maps dialectical words into their corresponding Modern Standard Arabic words. The experimentation reveals that the dialect lexicon improves the accuracies of the classifiers. © 2015 IEEE.",Dialectical Arabic; Modern Standard Arabic; Opinion Mining; Sentiment Analysis; Text Mining,Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Dialectical Arabic; Modern standards; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Text mining; Data mining,2-s2.0-84933564666

The phenomenal growth of e-commerce has led to a significantly large number of reviews for a product or service. This provides useful information to the users to take a fully informed decision on whether to acquire the service and/or product or not. In this paper we present a method for automatic feature selection for aspect term extraction and sentiment classification. The proposed approach is based on the principle of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and performs feature selection within the learning framework of Conditional Random Field (CRF). Experiments on the benchmark set up of SemEval- 2014 Aspect based Sentiment Analysis Shared Task show the F-measure values of 81.91% and 72.42% for aspect term extraction in the laptop and restaurant domains, respectively. The method yields the classification accuracies of 78.48% for the restaurant and 71.25% for the laptop domain. Comparisons with the baselines and other existing systems show that our proposed approach attains the promising accuracies with much reduced feature sets in all the settings. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Aspect extraction; Conditional random field; Feature selection; Particle Swarm Optimization; Sentiment analysis,Computational linguistics; Data mining; Extraction; Feature extraction; Information systems; Laptop computers; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Random processes; Text processing; Automatic feature selection; Classification accuracy; Conditional random field; Existing systems; Informed decision; Learning frameworks; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Natural language processing systems,2-s2.0-84948768456

The central problem is simple but tricky: given a crowdsourced task, who is the right worker to ask? Currently, most existing work has mainly studied the problem of crowd-selection for simple crowdsourced tasks such as decision making and sentiment analysis. Their crowd-selection procedures are based on the trustworthiness of workers. However, for some complex tasks such as document review and question answering, selecting workers based on the latent category of tasks is a better solution. In this paper, we formulate a new problem of task-driven crowd-selection for complex tasks. We first develop a Bayesian generative model to exploit ""who knows what"" for the workers in the crowdsourcing environment. The model provides a principle and natural framework for capturing the latent skills of workers as well as the latent categories of crowdsourced tasks. The inference of the latent skills of workers is based on past resolved crowdsourced tasks with feedback scores. We assume that the feedback scores can illustrate the performance of the workers for the tasks. We then devise a variational algorithm that transforms the latent skill inference with the proposed model into a standard optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently. We verify the performance of our method through extensive experiments on the data collected from three well-known crowdsourcing platforms for question answering tasks such as Quora, Yahoo! Answer and Stack Overflow. © 2015, Copyright is with the authors.",,Database systems; Decision making; Inference engines; Natural language processing systems; Optimization; Query processing; Bayesian generative models; Crowdsourcing platforms; Question Answering; Question Answering Task; Selection procedures; Sentiment analysis; Standard optimization; Variational algorithms; Crowdsourcing,2-s2.0-84976333362

Using panel data techniques, we examine the role of a wide set of potential drivers. To our knowledge, this paper presents one of the most exhaustive compilations of the variables used in the literature to study the behaviour of sovereign yield spreads and, in particular, to gauge the effect on these spreads of changes in market sentiment and risk aversion. We use a sample of both central and peripheral countries from January 1999 to December 2012 and assess whether there were significant changes after the outbreak of the euro area debt crisis. Our results suggest that the rise in sovereign risk in central countries can only be partially explained by the evolution of local macroeconomic variables in those countries. Besides, without exception, the marginal effects of sovereign spread drivers (specifically, the variables that measure global market sentiment) increased during the crisis compared to the pre-crisis period, especially in peripheral countries. Moreover, the increase in the significance of the banking level of indebtedness and foreign bank's claims in the public sector (mainly in peripheral countries) along with the crisis unfolding seems to highlight the interconnection between private and public debt and thus, between banking and sovereign crises. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Eurozone; Panel data; Sovereign bond spreads,,2-s2.0-84908345837

We found that astrophysicists communicate with a variety of user types (e.g. colleagues, science communicators, other researchers, and educators) and that in the ego networks of the astrophysicists clear groups consisting of users with different professional roles can be distinguished. Interestingly, the analysis of noun phrases and hashtags showed that when the astrophysicists address the different groups of very different professional composition they use very similar terminology, but that they do not talk to each other (i.e. mentioning other user names in tweets).

In this paper we propose solutions to acquire labels and cope with concept drift in this setting, by using findings from social psychology on how humans prefer to disclose some types of emotions. In particular, we use findings that humans are more motivated to report positive feelings rather than negative feelings and also prefer to report extreme feelings rather than average feelings. We map each of these self-report imbalances on two machine learning sub-tasks. The preference on the disclosure of positive feelings can be explored to generate labeled data on polarizing topics, where a positive event for one group usually induces negative feelings from the opposing group, generating an imbalance on user activity that unveils the current dominant sentiment. Based on the knowledge that extreme experiences are more reported than average experiences, we propose a feature representation strategy that focus on terms which appear at spikes in the social stream. When comparing to a static text representation (TF-IDF), we found that our feature representation is more capable of detecting new informative features that capture the sudden changes on sentiment stream caused by real-world events. We show that our social psychology-inspired framework produces accuracies up to 84% while analyzing live reactions in the debate of two popular sports on Twitter - soccer and football - despite requiring no human effort in generating supervisory labels. © 2014 ACM.",sentiment analysis; social media analytics; stream data mining,Artificial intelligence; Information retrieval; Learning systems; Sports; Websites; Concept drifts; Feature representation; Positive feelings; Sentiment analysis; Social media analytics; Social psychology; Stream data mining; Text representation; Data mining,2-s2.0-84906861443

In this paper, we demonstrate an application of Twitter to atomically determining road hazards. By building language models based on Twitter users' online communication, our system aims at pinpointing potential road hazards that pose driving risks. The likelihood of poor driving conditions can then be exposed via map overlays to warn drivers about potentially dangerous driving conditions in their locale or on current routes, thereby significantly reducing the chances of an accident occurring. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the utility of social media to automatically detect road hazards.

We propose that basic human values are one important determinant of such negative attitudes, and we seek to explain variation across countries in the strength of the effects of values. Based on Schwartz’ (1992, 1994) basic human value theory, we hypothesize that universalism values are conducive to positive attitudes toward immigration, while conformity-tradition reinforce anti-immigration sentiments. We furthermore hypothesize that these value effects are moderated by two contextual variables. Both value effects are expected to be weaker in countries with a higher level of cultural embeddedness. Furthermore, negative effects of conformity-tradition values are hypothesized to be cushioned by a lower proportion of immigrants in the country. A multilevel analysis of data from 24 countries from the fourth round of the European Social Survey (2008–2009) supports these hypotheses.

In this work, we use over 180 million geo coded tweets over an entire month to study how Twitter users from different cities expressed three different emotions: fear, sympathy and solidarity, in reaction to the bombings. We capture spikes in fear in different cities by using sentiment and time-series analyses, and track expressions of sympathy and solidarity based on the emergent use of two hash tags, # prayforboston and #bostonstrong , widely adopted after the bombings. We find first that the extent to which communities outside Boston express these emotions is correlated with their geographic proximity, social network connections, and residents’ direct, physical experiences with Boston (captured by the number of citizens who had visited Boston recently). This general effect shows interesting differences across the different kinds of emotions, however. Analyses show that the extent to which residents of a city visit Boston is the best predictor of fear and solidarity expression, as well as a strong predictor of the expression of sympathy. The expression of fear is also directly related to the expression of solidarity.

The computational study of opinions, feelings and emotions expressed in a text often relates to the identification of agreement or disagreement with statements, contained in comments or reviews, that convey positive or negative feelings. The detection and analysis of sentiment in textual communication is a topic attracting attention also in the context of collaborative learning in social networks, being learners actively engaged in presenting and defending ideas and opinions, as well as exchanging moods about courses with peers. In this paper, we investigate the adoption of a probabilistic approach based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) as Sentiment Grabber. Through this approach, for a set of documents belonging to a same knowledge domain, a graph, the Mixed Graph of Terms, can be automatically extracted. The paper shows how this graph contains a set of weighted word pairs, which are discriminative for sentiment classification. The proposed method has been tested in different context: a standard dataset containing movie reviews; a real-time analysis of social networks posts; a collaborative learning scenario. The experimental evaluation shows how the proposed approach is effective and satisfactory. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Information extraction; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Sentiment analysis,Computer aided instruction; Information retrieval; Social networking (online); Statistics; Collaborative learning; Collaborative learning environment; Experimental evaluation; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Latent dirichlet allocations; Probabilistic approaches; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Data mining,2-s2.0-84978023479

This study applied sentiment analysis-a data processing technique that codes textual data for emotional polarity-to examine how exposure to messages about the cessation drug varenicline affects smokers' decision making around its use. Methods: Data were from QuitNet, an online social network dedicated to smoking cessation and relapse prevention. Self-reported medication choice at registration and at 30 days was coded among new QuitNet registrants who participated in at least one forum discussion mentioning varenicline between January 31, 2005 and March 9, 2008. Commercially available software was used to code the sentiment of forum messages mentioning varenicline that occurred during this time frame. Logistic regression analyses examined whether forum message exposure predicted medication choice. Results: The sample of 2132 registrants comprised mostly women (78.3%), white participants (83.4%), averaged 41.2 years of age (SD = 10.9), and smoked on average 21.5 (SD = 9.7) cigarettes/day. After adjusting for potential confounders, as exposure to positive varenicline messages outweighed negative messages, the odds of switching to varenicline (odds ratio = 2.05, 95% confidence interval = 1.66 to 2.54) and continuing to use varenicline (odds ratio = 2.46, 95% confidence interval = 1.96 to 3.10) statistically significantly increased. Conclusions: Sentiment analysis is a useful tool for analyzing text-based data to examine their impact on behavior change. Greater exposure to positive sentiment in online conversations about varenicline is associated with a greater likelihood that smokers will choose to use varenicline in a quit attempt. © The Author 2013.

We assess the credibility of information by calculating the ratio of same opinions to all opinions about a topic. For identifying which topic is mentioned in a tweet, our method uses topic models generated by Latent Dirichlet Allocation. For identifying whether an opinion of a tweet is positive or negative, our method performs sentiment analysis using a semantic orientation dictionary.

This insight can be enriched by visualising information in its geographic context. Two underlying approaches for sentiment analysis are dictionary-based and machine learning. The former is popular for public sentiment analysis, and the latter has found limited use for aggregating public sentiment from Twitter data. The research presented in this paper aims to extend the machine learning approach for aggregating public sentiment. To this end, a framework for analysing and visualising public sentiment from a Twitter corpus is developed. A dictionary-based approach and a machine learning approach are implemented within the framework and compared using one UK case study, namely the royal birth of 2013. The case study validates the feasibility of the framework for analysis and rapid visualisation. One observation is that there is good correlation between the results produced by the popular dictionary-based approach and the machine learning approach when large volumes of tweets are analysed. However, for rapid analysis to be possible faster methods need to be developed using big data techniques and parallel methods. © 2013 IEEE.",aggregate sentiment; dictionary-based approach; machine learning; public opinion; royal birth; sentiment analysis; Twitter,dictionary-based approach; Public opinions; royal birth; Sentiment analysis; Twitter; Data mining; Learning systems; Research; Social aspects; Social networking (online),2-s2.0-84893338534

Customer responses that appear in social media, however, are typically unstructured; thus, a fairly large data set is needed for meaningful analysis. Although identifying customers' value structures and attitudes may be useful for developing targeted or niche markets, the unstructured and volume-heavy nature of customer data prohibits efficient and economical extraction of such information. Automatic extraction of customer information would be valuable in determining value structure and strength. This paper proposes an intelligent method of estimating causality between user profiles, value structures, and attitudes based on the replies and published content managed by open social network systems such as YouTube. To show the feasibility of the idea proposed in this paper, information richness and agility are used as underlying concepts to create performance measures based on media/information richness theory. The resulting deep sentiment analysis proves to be superior to legacy sentiment analysis tools for estimation of causality among the focal parameters. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Specific attention is paid to the role of interpretation in shaping these experiences. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative research method was employed, involving in-depth interviews with Australians who had visited Gallipoli in a range of circumstances. Findings: Australians visit Gallipoli for a variety of reasons, including national sentiment and personal connections. They engage with the site in a range of highly personal ways, with guides playing a crucial role in helping them to connect with the site physically, intellectually and emotionally.

Negation is usually considered as a polarity shifter, whereas intensifiers are regarded as amplifiers or diminishers of the strength of such polarity. Modality, in turn, has only been addressed in a very naïve fashion, so that modal forms are treated as polarity blockers. However, processing these constructions as mere polarity modifiers may be adequate for polarity classification, but it is not enough for more complex tasks (e.g., intensity classification), for which a more fine-grained model based on emotions is needed. In this work, we study the effect of modifiers on the emotions affected by them and propose a model of negation, intensifiers, and modality especially conceived for sentiment analysis tasks. We compare our emotion-based strategy with two traditional approaches based on polar expressions and find that representing the text as a set of emotions increases accuracy in different classification tasks and that this representation allows for a more accurate modeling of modifiers that results in further classification improvements. We also study the most common uses of modifiers in opinionated texts and quantify their impact in polarity and intensity classification. Finally, we analyze the joint effect of emotional modifiers and find that interesting synergies exist between them. © 2013 ASIS&T.",natural language processing; text mining,Accurate modeling; Classification tasks; Model-based OPC; NAtural language processing; Polarity classification; Sentiment analysis; Text mining; Traditional approaches; Classification (of information); Data mining; Natural language processing systems; Text processing,2-s2.0-84880323843

Sociology of law scholars have challenged this model on theoretical grounds, arguing persuasively that law is variable and often yields patterns that parallel broader considerations of community social organization and collective sentiment. The authors' analysis yields evidence that the certainty and severity of sanctions for murder cases are heightened where social capital is more plentiful, religious fundamentalist values more prevalent, and support for punitive sanctions is greater. They also find that sentences given to murder defendants are longer in areas in which the public expresses higher levels of fear.

Following the accession of ten new and predominantly Eastern European member-states to the European Union in 2004, this gambit was again utilised to provocatively portray migrant workers newly arriving in the United Kingdom as an external economic threat.

Design/methodology/approach: A bespoke collection of newspaper articles was assembled and examined using a corpus-based discourse analysis. The analysis was subsequently triangulated with relevant responses to a series of public opinion surveys. Findings: Results show that the British press conformed to classic media representations of migrants when referring to Poles in particular, by depicting them as an external economic threat ""flooding"" the country; in addition a novel stereotype of the ""Polish plumber"" was used to present them arriving to take the jobs of native manual labourers.

Killing leads to distress, in part, due to guilt experienced from violating moral standards. Because social consensus shapes what actions are perceived as moral and just, we hypothesized that social validation for killing would reduce guilt, whereas social invalidation would exacerbate it. To examine this possibility in a laboratory setting, participants were led to kill bugs in an ""extermination task."" Perceptions of social validation/invalidation were manipulated through the supposed actions of a confederate (Study 1) or numerous previous participants (Study 2) that agreed or refused to kill bugs. Distress measures focused on trauma-related guilt. Higher levels of distress were observed when individuals perceived their actions as invalidated as opposed to when they perceived their actions as socially validated.

Results: Despite their concerns about information safety and security, respondents in all 4 (1 pre-implementation and 3 post-implementation) surveyed groups indicated an acceptance of and willingness to endorse HIE technology. Eighty percent of respondents with the HIE experience chose HIE as their preferred operation of information exchange whereas the figure was 55% and 59% in the comparison groups A and B, respectively. The proportion of respondents who indicated improved quality as the reason for their willingness to recommend or to participate was higher than the proportion who cited reduced healthcare bills in all 3 groups - 8% in the HIE group and 13% and 23% in the comparison groups A and B, respectively, cited improved quality as the reason and .4% in the HIE group and 4% and 8% in the comparison groups A and B, respectively, cited reduced healthcare bills as the reason. Conclusions: The public sentiment is favorable for HIE technology in South Korea, but study findings indicate a gap among perceptions of different patient groups. Education and other efforts to give the public accurate information on benefits and adverse effects of the technology are needed. Also, additional objective studies with empirical data should be conducted to obtain quantitative evidence of benefits and adverse effects of the technology. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Community networks; Electronic health records; Health information exchange; Health information technology; Patient perception,"Adverse effect; Chi-square tests; Community networks; Comparison group; Demographic characteristics; Descriptive statistics; Electronic health record; Empirical data; Health informations; Information exchanges; Information safety; Medical record; Perceived benefits; Pilot programs; Post-implementation; South Korea; Health care; Information technology; Statistical tests; Surveys; Information dissemination; accuracy; adult; article; confidentiality; controlled study; data analysis; demography; electronic medical record; female; health information exchange; human; information technology; major clinical study; male; medical information; medical information system; outpatient care; patient attitude; patient preference; perception; priority journal; quality control; quantitative analysis; risk benefit analysis; safety; structured questionnaire; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attitude to Health; Electronic Health Records; Female; Health Information Management; Health Promotion; Health Records, Personal; Humans; Male; Medical Informatics; Middle Aged; Patient Participation; Pilot Projects; Republic of Korea; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84873059829

Sentiment analysis brings together various research areas such as natural language processing, data mining and text mining, and is fast becoming of major importance to organizations as they integrate online commerce into their operations. This paper proposes improved methods for aspect-level sentiment analysis. We propose to utilize bag of nouns instead of bog of words to improve the clustering results for aspect identification and a new feature set, score representation, that leads to more accurate sentiment identification. This scheme is based upon the three scores (positive ness, neutral ness and negative ness) that are learned from the data for each term. Using this new score representation scheme, we improve the performance of 3-class sentiment analysis on sentences by 20% in terms of f1-measure, as compared to previously published research.

While finegrained subjectivity annotations are rarely available, encouraging results have been obtained by modeling subjectivity as a latent variable. However, latent variable models fail to capitalize on our linguistic knowledge about discourse structure. We present a new method for injecting linguistic knowledge into latent variable subjectivity modeling, using discourse connectors. Connector-Augmented transition features allow the latent variable model to learn the relevance of discourse connectors for subjectivity transitions, without subjectivity annotations. This yields significantly improved performance on documentlevel sentiment analysis in English and Spanish.

Computer and information scientists are developing automated methods for sentiment analysis of online text. Most of the studies have focused on identifying sentiment polarity or orientation - whether a document, usually a product or movie review, carries a positive or negative sentiment. It is time for researchers to address more sophisticated kinds of sentiment analysis. This paper aims to evaluate a particular linguistic framework called appraisal theory for adoption in manual as well as automatic sentiment analysis of news text. Design/methodology/approach - The appraisal theory is applied to the analysis of a sample of political news articles reporting on Iraq and the economic policies of George W. Bush and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to assess its utility and to identify challenges in adopting this framework. Findings - The framework was useful in uncovering various aspects of sentiment that should be useful for researchers, such as the appraisers and object of appraisal, bias of the appraisers and the author, type of attitude and manner of expressing the sentiment. Problems encountered include difficulty in identifying appraisal phrases and attitude categories because of the subtlety of expression in political news articles, lack of treatment of tense and timeframe, lack of a typology of emotions, and need to identify different types of behaviours (political, verbal and material actions) that reflect sentiment. Originality/value - The study has identified future directions for research in automated sentiment analysis as well as sentiment analysis of online news text. It has also demonstrated how sentiment analysis of news text can be carried out. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Appraisal theory; Content analysis; Linguistics; Political news; Sentiment analysis,Appraisal theory; Automated methods; Content analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Economic policies; Emotion processing; Negative sentiments; Online news; Political news; Sentiment analysis; Linguistics; Materials properties; Research; Social sciences; Data mining,2-s2.0-84870272153

Our research is motivated by a small number of search engines dominating a market in which there are little switching costs. The major research goal is to investigate the effect that brand logos have on search engine brand knowledge, which includes brand image and brand awareness. To investigate this goal, we employ a survey of 207 participants and use a mixed method approach of sentiment analysis and mutual information statistic to investigate our research questions. Our findings reveal that some search engines have logos that do not communicate a clear meaning, resulting in a confused brand message. Brand image varies among the top search engines, with consumers possessing generally extremely positive or negative brand opinions. Google elicited a string of positive comments from the participants, to the point of several uses of the term 'love.' This is in line with the ultimate brand equity that Google has achieved (i. e., the generic term for web search). Most of the other search engines, including Microsoft, had primarily negative terms associated with them, although AOL, Ask, and Yahoo! had a mix of both positive and negative comments.

Starting from the premise that Islamophobic attitudes are more nuanced than a simple dislike of Muslims, I focus on specific forms of attitudes which link Muslims to violence and terrorism. Data from the Pew Global Attitudes Surveys are used to test three theories: perceived threat, social identity, and cognitive capabilities. A series of logit estimations are used for the empirical analysis of individual level data in the USA, Great Britain, France, Germany, and Spain. The results show that perceived realistic and symbolic threat is the most significant source of Islamophobic attitudes in the West. While individuals cognitively differentiate between general feelings toward Muslims and their specific characteristics, higher levels of education significantly reduces negative sentiments. A good number of Westerners think of Muslims as violent individuals while some believe that they support al-Qaeda. Citizens in the West are more likely to associate Muslims with terrorism if they feel threatened by their physical and cultural existence. © 2012 Copyright Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs.",,,2-s2.0-84870265542

However, news articles usually have other attributes such as source, author, date and time, length, and sentiment which should be taken into account. In addition, news articles and keywords have complicated macro/micro relations, which include relations between news articles (i.e., macro relation), relations between keywords (i.e., micro relation), and relations between news articles and keywords (i.e., macro-micro relation). These macro/micro relations are time varying and pose special challenges for news analysis. In this article we present a visual analytics system for news streams which can bring multiple attributes of the news articles and the macro/micro relations between news streams and keywords into one coherent analytical context, all the while conveying the dynamic natures of news streams. We introduce a new visualization primitive called TextWheel which consists of one or multiple keyword wheels, a document transportation belt, and a dynamic system which connects the wheels and belt. By observing the TextWheel and its content changes, some interesting patterns can be detected.

Problems such as sentiment and opinion mining, and prediction of election outcomes have become tremendously popular due to the unprecedented availability of social interactivity data of different types. An important angle that has not yet been explored is to estimate beliefs from posts made on social media. We propose that social media can be used to monitor the level of belief, disbelief and doubt related to specific propositions. Inspired by efforts in disease surveillance using social media we coin the term belief surveillance for this function. We propose a novel methodological framework for belief surveillance using Twitter. Our method may be used to gauge belief on any proposition as long as it is specifiable in a form that we call probes. We present our belief estimates for 32 probes some of which represent factual information, others represent false information and the remaining represent debatable propositions. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence suggesting that off-the-shelf classifiers may be used to automatically estimate belief.

It exploits supervised learning methods to learn the classifiers from the annotated training documents. The challenge in sentiment classification lies in that the sentiment domains are diverse, heterogeneous and fast-growing. The classifiers trained on one domain (source domain) could not classify a document from another domain (target domain). The domain adaptation technique is to address the problem by making use of labeled samples in the source domain, and unlabeled samples in the target domain. This paper presents a new solution, a cross-domain topic indexing (CDTI) method, with which a common semantic space is found from the prior between-domain term correspondences and the term co-occurrences in the cross-domain documents. These observations are characterized with the mixture model in CDTI, with each component being a possible topic shared by the source and target domains. Such common topics are found to index the cross-domain content. We evaluate the algorithms on a multi-domain sentiment classification task, which shows that CDTI outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaptation method, i.e. spectral feature alignment (SFA), and the traditional latent semantic indexing method. © 2011 ACM.",domain adaptation; latent topic analysis; opinion mining; sentiment classification,Adaptation methods; Commercial applications; Cross-domain; Domain adaptation; Latent Semantic Indexing; Mixture model; Multi domains; Opinion mining; Semantic Space; Sentiment classification; Spectral feature; Supervised learning methods; Target domain; Topic analysis; Training documents; Unlabeled samples; Indexing (of information); Knowledge management; Semantics; Text processing,2-s2.0-83055161732

Herein, ensemble models provide us the flexibility of tuning the weights of corresponding classifiers in order to adapt to the new domain. Our approach is supported by a solid theoretical analysis based on the expressiveness of ensemble classifiers, which allows trading-off errors across source and target domains.

Connotation lexicons differ from much studied sentiment lexicons: the latter concerns words that express sentiment, while the former concerns words that evoke or associate with a specific polarity of sentiment. Understanding the connotation of words would seem to require common sense and world knowledge. However, we demonstrate that much of the connotative polarity of words can be inferred from natural language text in a nearly unsupervised manner. The key linguistic insight behind our approach is selectional preference of connotative predicates. We present graph-based algorithms using PageRank and HITS that collectively learn connotation lexicon together with connotative predicates.

Our goal is to automatically predict future reviews for a given author from previous reviews. For this goal, we focus on differentiating author's preference, unlike previous sentiment analysis models which process review articles without this difference. We propose a Latent Evaluation Topic model (LET) that infers each author's preference by introducing novel latent variables into author and his/her document layer. Because these variables distinguish the variety of words in each article by merging similar word distributions, LET incorporates the difference of writers' preferences into sentiment analysis. Consequently, LET can determine the attitude of writers, and predict their reviews based on like-minded writers' reviews in the collaborative filtering approach. Experiments on review articles show that the proposed model can reduce the dimensionality of reviews to the low-dimensional set of these latent variables; it represents a significant improvement over standard sentiment analysis models and collaborative filtering algorithms.

Reviewers usually praise a product in some aspects and bemoan it in other aspects. With the business globalization, it is very important for enterprises to extract the opinions toward different aspects and find out cross-lingual/cross-culture difference in opinions. Cross-lingual opinion mining is a very challenging task as amounts of opinions are written in different languages, and not well structured. Since people usually use different words to describe the same aspect in the reviews, product-feature (PF) categorization becomes very critical in cross-lingual opinion mining. Manual cross-lingual PF categorization is time consuming, and practically infeasible for the massive amount of data written in different languages. In order to effectively find out cross-lingual difference in opinions, we present an aspect-oriented opinion mining method with Cross-lingual Latent Semantic Association (CLaSA). We first construct CLaSA model to learn the cross-lingual latent semantic association among all the PFs from multi-dimension semantic clues in the review corpus. Then we employ CLaSA model to categorize all the multilingual PFs into semantic aspects, and summarize cross-lingual difference in opinions towards different aspects. Experimental results show that our method achieves better performance compared with the existing approaches.

In this paper; we propose a sentence level machine learning approach for sentiment classification of online reviews. The proposed method extracts the subjective sentences from the reviews and label each sentence either positive or negative based on its word level feature using naïve Näve Bayesian (NB) classifier. The labeled sentences create an annotated set of sentences called as BOS (Bag-of-Sentences). We train Support Vector machine (SVM) classifier on the BOS for sentences polarity classification. The contextual information in each sentence structure is taken into consideration to calculate the semantic orientation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated thought simulation. Results show that our machine learning based proposed method on average achieves accuracy of 81% and 83% with some contextual information. This method improves the sentiment classification polarity on sentence level unlike the word level lexical feature based work, by focus on sentences, this also concentrate on contextual information.

Because many customers feel that they can purchase product based on the experiences of others that are obtainable through product reviews, the review summarization process has become important. In particular, feature-based product review summarization is needed in order to satisfy the detailed needs of some customers. To achieve such summarization, numerous techniques using natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and statistical approaches that can evaluate product features within a collection of review documents have been studied. Many of these techniques require sentiment analysis or feature scoring methods. However, existing sentiment analysis methods are limited when determining the sentiment polarity of context-sensitive words, and existing feature scoring methods are limited when only the overall user score is used to evaluate individual product features. In our summarization approach, context-sensitive information is used to determine sentiment polarity while opinioned-feature frequency is used to determine feature scores. Based on experiments with actual review data, our method improved the accuracy of the calculated feature scores and outperformed existing methods.",Feature scoring; Opinion mining; Product review summarization; Sentiment analysis; User score,Feature scoring; Opinion mining; Product reviews; Sentiment analysis; User score; Computational linguistics; Data mining; Learning algorithms; Sales; Natural language processing systems,2-s2.0-78650036171

Consumers, non-profit organizations, and other forms of communities are extremely vocal about their opinions and perceptions on companies and their brands on the web. The ability to leverage such ""voice of the web"" to gain consumer, brand, and market insights can be truly differentiating and valuable to today's corporations. In particular, one important form of insights can be derived from sentiment analysis on web content. Sentiment analysis traditionally emphasizes on classification of web comments into positive, neutral, and negative categories. This paper goes beyond sentiment classification by focusing on techniques that could detect the topics that are highly correlated with the positive and negative opinions. Such techniques, when coupled with sentiment classification, can help the business analysts to understand both the overall sentiment scope as well as the drivers behind the sentiment. In this paper, we describe our overall sentiment analysis system that consists of such sentiment analysis techniques, including the bootstrapping method for word polarities weighting, automatic filtering and expansion for domain word, and a sentiment classification method.

Two new innovations are introduced. First, the authors identify two macroeconomic factors, in addition to risk-free Treasury rates, that greatly impact cap rates-the general corporate risk premium operating in the economy and the amount of debt (liquidity) available. The addition of these factors greatly adds to the ability of previous models to explain the secular fall of cap rates in the last decade and their recent rise. Second, the authors search for ""structural"" shifts in the cap rate using innovative tests, including a large number of macroeconomic factors. The tests identify two distinct periods that the authors label as ""investor sentiment."" A period of negative sentiment was identified from 1991 to 1996 and a period of positive sentiment was identified from 2002 to 2007. Methodologically, the analysis uses a large and robust quarterly panel dataset of 30 U.S. metropolitan areas from 1980 Q1 through 2007 Q4.

The authors also document several interesting new results that are clearly unambiguous and significantly stronger than in earlier work, or opposite to earlier evidence, or for variables that have been examined for the first time. The results show that 1) market sentiment has a negative and significant effect on RNS; 2) the higher a firm's own volatility, the more negative the RNS, a relationship that is in the same direction as for overall market volatility; 3) greater market liquidity is associated with more negative RNS, but the liquidity that is relevant for RNS is that of the options market, rather than that in the underlying stock.

The paper also empirically tests for associations between consumer attitudes toward marketing, satisfaction with marketing mix and perception of government regulation in least developing countries (LDCs) using the structural equations modelling. Design/methodology/approach - A multi-stage cluster sample of 600 consumers was surveyed to measure consumer sentiment toward marketing in Bangladesh and to test the theoretical model. Data were analyzed using analysis of variances and structural equations modelling. Findings - The study found Bangladeshi consumers are aggregately more unfavourable towards marketing practices in comparison to transitional countries and less unfavourable in comparison to developed ones. The marketing sentiment scale showed evidence of divergent, convergent and predictive validity. The results from the structural equation paths provided evidence that associations do exist between attitudes toward marketing, satisfaction and government regulation variables. The study also revealed that there were no significant differences in attitude towards government regulation with respect to various demographics variables. Research limitations/implications - This is the first such research carried out in an LDC, similar studies need to be carried out in other LDCs to validate the findings further. Practical implications - It gives an insight into the mind of the Bangladeshi consumers. It can be useful for marketers in designing effective marketing programs and positioning of existing and future products in LDCs.

Phase Two occurred after economic buoyancy was achieved, as the demands of rapid growth threatened communities, the environment and Irish heritage in the face of major infrastructural projects such as roads, incinerators and gas pipelines.

It argues that previous analyses privilege one aspect of the dispute over the other. Some stress the nationalist dimension of the dispute while others argue the primary motivations relate to the material wealth of the seabed combined with increased energy needs in China and Japan. By analysing the interaction between the nationalist (ideational) and resource (material) dimensions, it becomes clear why it has become increasingly difficult for policy elites in either state to seek compromise. This is because nationalist constituencies in China and Japan have extended their nationalist/ideational sentiment from the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands to the entire East China Sea. Simultaneously, Beijing and Tokyo's interest in the material exploitation and security of the East China Sea has risen. This convergence between nationalist and elite interest became clear in April 2005 and significantly raised bilateral tensions over the East China Sea until October 2005. These findings indicate that it will remain difficult for elites to manage the dispute in the future, particularly in light of the red line drawn by China at the end of the 2005 crisis. Most importantly, compromise on the material aspects of the dispute has become beholden to nationalist prerogatives. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.",China-Japan relations; Dispute management; East China Sea dispute; Territorial dispute,,2-s2.0-77950737150

Personalized technologies such as information recommendation are currently hot topic of Web intelligence. Among them, TV program recommendation is expected to be one of the practical applications in near future, as digital TV service and partner robots providing personalized support are getting into our living environment. The proposed method does not estimate user's interest in a TV program only from its watching time as most of existing methods do, but also from user's utterances by applying sentiment analysis. The method employs fuzzy inference for estimating the user's rating of a TV program. A user profiles with bookmark format is generated based on the estimated rating of TV programs. Experiments are performed by collecting TV watching logs with diary-based approach, and the results show the proposed method can generate a user profile that can reflect user's interests. © 2007 IEEE.",,Digital TV; Information recommendation; Intelligent agent technology; International conferences; Living environment; Partner robots; Program recommendation; Sentiment analysis; TV programs; User profiling; User's interest; Web intelligence; Digital television; Estimation; Fuzzy inference; Television broadcasting; Technology,2-s2.0-48149106381

The central object of the theory is altruistic gift-giving, construed as benevolent voluntary redistribution of income or wealth. The theory concentrates on lump-sum voluntary transfers, individual or collective, which aim at equalizing the distribution of wealth from altruistic reasons or sentiments (perfectly substitutable altruistic transfers). It implies: (i) the Pareto-inefficiency of the non-cooperative interaction of individual altruistic transfers; (ii) the neutralization of public transfers by individual altruistic transfers; (iii) and the crowding out of private altruistic transfers by Pareto-efficient public redistribution. The chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an informal overview of the general intent and content of the theory. Section 3 gives a first formal version of the theory in a one-commodity setup (pure distributive social system). Non-cooperative distributive equilibrium is characterized, and its fundamental properties of existence and determinacy are analyzed. Section 4 extends the definitions and fundamental properties of pure distributive social systems to general social systems that combine competitive market exchange with the non-cooperative altruistic transfers of individuals endowed with non-paternalistic interdependent preferences. Section 5 states the neutrality property in two versions of the theory successively: the general social systems of Section 4; and the important special case of the pure distributive social systems of Section 3, where the set of agents is partitioned in two subsets, namely, a subset of ""poor"" individuals with zero endowments and egoistic preferences, and a subset of ""rich"" individuals altruistic to the poor and indifferent to each other. Section 6 reviews the theory of Pareto-efficient redistribution in pure distributive social systems. Section 7 returns to the fundamental assumption of perfect substitutability of transfers through a selective review of theoretical models of imperfectly substitutable transfers and empirical tests of perfect substitutability. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Every song that reached the number one position in a given year was included in the database. Explicit working definitions of politics and ideology were adopted. Using a simplified content analysis approach, 20 issues or concepts were developed for coding. A surprisingly small total of only 73 songs, or roughly 6%, were found to contain significant observations of a political or ideological nature. It is concluded that, contrary to standard notions, commercial country music does not regularly display religious, populist, patriarchal, or politically conservative views. Rather, the most successful songs have been explicitly apolitical, even anti-political, in their rejection and apparent unawareness of social and economic conditions outside the lives of the song characters themselves. In sum, it must be asserted that the best-selling country songs contain significantly less political sentiment than is typically assumed.",,,2-s2.0-34347309128

These are letters addressed to the President of the Republic by the elite of a specific ethnic group or region of the country whenever one of their members is promoted to an important position in the State bureaucracy, or state-owned enterprise that places the individual in a position to benefit himself and members of the group that he represents. The objectives of these letters are threefold: (1) to thank the President for compensating the region and its people; (2) to pledge the group's continuous and unflinching political support to the President; and (3) to remind the President that this pledge is a function of his ability to ensure a steady flow of ""development projects"" to their region. A content analysis of some of these motions of support would enable us to place them within the context of the politics of exclusion, and to emphasize that by giving vent to ethnoregional sentiments, Cameroon's body politic hinges on a system of patronage that is systematically melting away the unity of the country. © 2004 by Association of Third World Studies, Inc.",,ethnopolitics; national politics; regional politics; Africa; Cameroon; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa,2-s2.0-3543090483

Using repeat sales in transaction data to proxy for holding period and prepayment, this paper provides the first rigorous analysis of residential mortgage prepayment in Singapore. The prepayment rate for new condominiums is increasing in the holding period and exhibits spikes in the fourth and sixth years. The likelihood of observing a subsequent sale and the prepayment rate increases in floor level, sentiment and other investment return, but decreases in floor area and mortgage rate hikes. Appreciation in the property price also tends to increase the probability and rate of prepayment. In contrast, owners of larger property units and HDB upgraders are less likely to resell their properties. The evidence also suggests that the likelihood of prepayment is lowered after the anti-speculation measures were introduced in May 1996. © 2000, MCB UP Limited",Mortgages; Payments; Risk; Singapore,,2-s2.0-84986156145

Yet, public opinion has a potentially large impact on local school boards' plans and policies when communities seek or obtain unitary status. Scholarship suggests that self-interest, racial attitudes, and philosophical values shape antibusing sentiments. Analysis of survey data from Nashville, Tennessee, shows that they do there as well. More important, though, further analysis shows that perceptions of busing's failure, which seem to be misguided, have a substantial impact on whether respondents want busing to end, even when race, self-interest, and ideological values are controlled. Perception, as mis-perception, is therefore a potentially salient factor in policy evaluation. Perceptions of policy success or failure may be socially constructed by media, elites, or people themselves. Additional research in this direction is clearly necessary.",,,2-s2.0-0034341235

This study aimed to investigate the influences of treatment intervention on the personality of migraineurs. Twenty-three Chinese patients (5 men, 18 women) with migraine (2 with aura, 21 without aura) were given the Chinese edition of the MMPI, before and after treatment, and were compared with 30 nonheadache healthy control subjects (6 men, 24 women). Statistical analyses were made among the three groups. The results revealed that patients in the pretreatment group with migraine had significantly higher scores on subtests of neuroticism (hypochondriasis, depression, hysteria) and schizophrenia. After treatment, the scores on subtests of hysteria, psychasthenia, and schizophrenia were remarkably lower (P<.05); the MMPI profile of the posttreatment group was within the reference range, but the scores of the neurotic scales were still higher than those of the healthy control group (P<.01). These results suggest that after treatment, disturbances in thinking, sentiment, and behavior were eliminated, and anxiety symptoms remarkably reduced, but some 'migraine personality' characteristics remained and could influence the long-term results of treatment to some extent.

Information was requested from all local councils. All primary schools in two local government areas were followed up, providing an indication of the validity of the analysis obtained from data collected during the mid‐year census. From 166 of 210 local councils in Victoria, 48 422 documents relating to school entry immunisation certificates were issued for children entering their preparatory year. At least 522 children were enrolled in school on an undertaking to complete immunisation, and were likely to have had their immunisation completed as a result of the legislation. Only 170 statutory declarations of conscientious objection to immunisation were made, indicating that few parents are willing to express firm anti‐vaccine sentiments. Compliance with the immunisation certificate legislation is overestimated by the mid‐year census because many schools have accepted nonstatutory evidence of immunisation. Mobile and immigrant families find it particularly difficult to achieve certification. Local councils are inconsistent in the way in which they issue certificates. Further follow‐up and feedback is essential to better inform schools and parents about the legislation. Such follow‐up can improve the certification rates of children then and in subsequent years. The legislation has imposed a considerable workload on councils, but without efforts to improve compliance with the legislation and to develop practical guidelines for documentation of immunisation and appropriate guidelines regarding transfer, many inadequately immunised children may remain at risk from vaccine‐preventable diseases. 1994 Public Health Association of Australia",,article; Australia; child; documentation; health care quality; human; immunization; legal aspect; methodology; organization and management; preventive health service; school; Child; Documentation; Human; Immunization; Immunization Programs; Program Evaluation; Schools; Victoria,2-s2.0-0028506505

An overlooked avenue to understanding his enterprise is his analysis of the practice of daily conversation, both as a medium of moral knowledge and as a source of the sorts of virtues possible in commercial society. In his attempt to answer the challenge of egoistic, “licentious” philosophers such as Bernard Mandeville—whose notion of “private vices, public benefits” typified the then-fashionable argument that modern society is held together not by virtues, but by the mutual satisfaction of interests-Smith drew on a combination of natural law theory and Scottish sociology to fashion a conception of moderate virtue that could harmonize prudenceand benevolence, as well as the “masculine” virtues of self-command and the “feminine” virtues of humanity, in ways consonant with the character of daily interactions in a modern society. © 1992, University of Notre Dame.

Various comparisons within the malignant group suggest that women with cancers of non-sexual sites may be more neurotic and show less integration of the self-sentiment and that women with breast cancer may be characterized by more covert relative to overt evidence of anxiety. A species of item analysis, carried out using X2, yielded 14 items which significantly differentiated the experimental from the control group. The bulk of these contribute towards anxiety but a few show the malignant group as less anxious. There is also some limited evidence of emotional toughness and depression on the part of the cancer patients. Women with lesions of non-sexual sites as distinct from sexual sites seem characterized by 'ready admission' and the higher anxiety score contributed by such a tendency. This is based on 4 items which significantly differentiate these 2 subgroupings. It seems best to interpret most of the data as consequent upon the subjects being cases of malignancy. The odd bits of data that might conceivably be construed as reflecting the pre-morbid personality of these women seem insufficient grounds upon which to stake a claim for a psychosomatic element in malignant disease. This may only mean that we have not yet hit upon the gauge which will give us the measure of something, upon which eminent men from Galen's time to the present have insisted-if not always with full accord as to its nature-was there. The very real possibility that cancer patients are given to motivational distortion in the context of self-rating instruments raises problems as to what form this gauge might take and still retain the properties of a simply administered screening device. In the last analysis it seems likely that future researches will have to select the more promising findings of such retrospective, metric researches as exist and enter upon a long-term, prospective study akin to that reported by Hagnell [5]. Only in this fashion can the probability of there being a predisposing entity in malignant etiology which takes the form of some aspect of personality be reliably assessed. Meanwhile, inadequate as they must be with respect to a final answer, the smaller retrospective studies can contribute some sort of preliminary reconnaissance of a more than usually tangled but interesting battlefield. © 1968.",,anxiety; article; breast tumor; depression; ego; female; frustration; guilt; human; neoplasm; neurosis; ovary tumor; psychologic test; psychometry; psychosomatic disorder; self concept; sex; uterus cancer; Anxiety; Breast Neoplasms; Depression; Ego; Female; Frustration; Guilt; Human; Neoplasms; Neurotic Disorders; Ovarian Neoplasms; Psychological Tests; Psychometrics; Psychophysiologic Disorders; Self Concept; Sex; Uterine Neoplasms,2-s2.0-0014348084

In response, we sought to develop a paradigm of a multiobjective, optimization-based weighted voting scheme to assign appropriate weight values to classifiers and each output class based on the predictive performance of classification algorithms, all to enhance the predictive performance of sentiment classification. The proposed ensemble method is based on static classifier selection involving majority voting error and forward search, as well as a multiobjective differential evolution algorithm. Based on the static classifier selection scheme, our proposed ensemble method incorporates Bayesian logistic regression, naïve Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and support vector machines as base learners, whose performance in terms of precision and recall values determines weight adjustment.

In building dimensional sentiment applications, affective lexicons with VA ratings are useful resources but are still very rare. Several semi-supervised methods such as the kernel method, linear regression, and the pagerank algorithm have been investigated to automatically determine the VA ratings of affective words from a set of semantically similar seed words. These methods suffer from two major limitations. First, they apply an equal weight to all seeds similar to an unseen word in predicting its VA ratings. Second, even similar seeds may have quite different ratings (or an inverse polarity) of valence/arousal to the unseen word, thus reducing prediction performance. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a community-based weighted graph model that can select seeds which are both similar to and have similar ratings (or the same polarity) with each unseen word to form a community (subgraph) so that its VA ratings can be estimated from such high-quality seeds using a weighted propagation scheme. That is, seeds more similar to unseen words contribute more to the estimation process. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields better prediction performance for both English and Chinese datasets. © 2014 IEEE.",Affective lexicon; community discovery; sentiment analysis; valence-arousal (VA) prediction; weighted graph model,Data mining; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Inverse problems; Natural language processing systems; Supervised learning; Affective lexicon; Community discoveries; Estimation process; Multiple dimensions; Prediction performance; Semi-supervised method; Sentiment analysis; Weighted graph; Forecasting,2-s2.0-84982256752

Looking at historical trends, contemporary rhetoric, and public opinion data, we find that populism is an appropriate descriptor of the 2016 election and that Donald Trump stands out in particular as the populist par excellence. Historical data reveal a large “representation gap” that typically accompanies populist candidates. Content analysis of campaign speeches shows that Trump, more so than any other candidate, employs a rhetoric that is distinctive in its simplicity, anti-elitism, and collectivism. Original survey data show that Trump’s supporters are distinctive in their unique combination of anti-expertise, anti-elitism, and pronationalist sentiments. Together, these findings highlight the distinctiveness of populism as a mechanism of political mobilization and the unusual character of the 2016 race. © 2016, © 2016 by The American Academy of Political and Social Science.",content analysis; Donald Trump; elections; political representation; populism; public opinion,,2-s2.0-84983565483

Existing word embedding learning algorithms typically only use the contexts of words but ignore the sentiment of texts. It is problematic for sentiment analysis because the words with similar contexts but opposite sentiment polarity, such as good and bad, are mapped to neighboring word vectors. We address this issue by encoding sentiment information of texts (e.g., sentences and words) together with contexts of words in sentiment embeddings. By combining context and sentiment level evidences, the nearest neighbors in sentiment embedding space are semantically similar and it favors words with the same sentiment polarity. In order to learn sentiment embeddings effectively, we develop a number of neural networks with tailoring loss functions, and collect massive texts automatically with sentiment signals like emoticons as the training data. Sentiment embeddings can be naturally used as word features for a variety of sentiment analysis tasks without feature engineering. We apply sentiment embeddings to word-level sentiment analysis, sentence level sentiment classification, and building sentiment lexicons. Experimental results show that sentiment embeddings consistently outperform context-based embeddings on several benchmark datasets of these tasks.

Machine learning methods for sentiment classification have been extensively studied, due to their predominant classification performance. Recent studies suggest that ensemble based machine learning methods provide better performance in classification. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are rarely being investigated in the literature of sentiment classification. This paper compares neural network based sentiment classification methods (back propagation neural network (BPN), probabilistic neural network (PNN) & homogeneous ensemble of PNN (HEN)) using varying levels of word granularity as features for feature level sentiment classification. They are validated using a dataset of product reviews collected from the Amazon reviews website. An empirical analysis is done to compare results of ANN based methods with two statistical individual methods. The methods are evaluated using five different quality measures and results show that the homogeneous ensemble of the neural network method provides better performance. Among the two neural network approaches used, probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) outperform in classifying the sentiment of the product reviews.

This combination is achieved through a mapping function within a sentiment-aware nearest neighbor model (SANN), which serves as an effective personalized ranker of items according to their hypothesized relevance to users. The mapping function can be adapted to specific datasets through a machine learning algorithm. We evaluate the proposed models and compare them with state-of-the-art multimedia recommendation methods, by casting the recommendation task as a top-N retrieval task over three real-world datasets: TED lectures, Vimeo videos and Flickr images. The experimental results show that the proposed models outperform all other alternatives in a majority of cases, thus demonstrating the generality of the approach. In particular, the superiority of the adaptive sentiment-aware models validates our hypothesis that there are inherent relationships between sentiments expressed in comments and unary feedback, both at community and individual levels. The improvements due to our models are consistent across all three datasets, they are present over three different assumptions on the negative class (i.e. items that are not seen or not liked), and they increase as comments become more abundant. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.",Multimedia recommendation; One-class collaborative filtering; Sentiment analysis,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mapping; Individual levels; Mapping functions; Multimedia recommendation; Nearest neighbor model; Novel applications; Real-world datasets; Recommendation methods; Sentiment analysis; Collaborative filtering,2-s2.0-84944088763

This is rapidly creating unique contents of massive dimensions that need to be efficiently and effectively analyzed to create actionable knowledge for decision making processes. A key information that can be grasped from social environments relates to the polarity of text messages. To better capture the sentiment orientation of the messages, several valuable expressive forms could be taken into account. In this paper, three expressive signals - typically used in microblogs - have been explored: (1) adjectives, (2) emoticon, emphatic and onomatopoeic expressions and (3) expressive lengthening. Once a text message has been normalized to better conform social media posts to a canonical language, the considered expressive signals have been used to enrich the feature space and train several baseline and ensemble classifiers aimed at polarity classification.

This approach overcomes the overlooked use of OSNs in Recommender Systems (RSs) and utilizes the widely available information from such networks. Bearing in mind that a user's selection is greatly influenced by his/her trusted friends and their opinions, this paper presents a framework to apply a new source of data to personalise recommendations by mining their friends' short text posts in microbloggings. ISTS maps suggested recommendations into numerical rating scales by applying three main components: (1) measuring the implicit trust between friends based on the intercommunication activities; (2) inferring the sentiment rating to reflect the knowledge behind friends' short posts, so-called micro-reviews, using sentiment techniques adding several ONSs language features to empower the extracted sentiment; (3) identifying the impact degree of trust level between friends and sentiment rating from micro-reviews on recommendations by using machine learning regression algorithms including linear regression, random forest and support vector regression (SVR).

Many opinion keywords carry varying polarities in different contexts, posing huge challenges for sentiment analysis research. Previous work on contextual polarity disambiguation makes use of term-level context, such as words and patterns, and resolves the polarity with a range of rule-based, statistics-based or machine learning methods. The major shortcoming of these methods lies in that the term-level features sometimes are ineffective in resolving the polarity. In this work, opinion-level context is explored, in which intra-opinion features and inter-opinion features are finely defined. To enable effective use of opinion-level features, the Bayesian model is adopted to resolve the polarity in a probabilistic manner. Experiments with the Opinmine corpus demonstrate that opinion-level features can make a significant contribution in word polarity disambiguation in four domains. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Bayesian model; Opinion-level features; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment disambiguation,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Learning systems; Bayesian model; Machine learning methods; Opinion-level features; Rule based; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment disambiguation; Bayesian networks,2-s2.0-84929702394

This is true in sentiment analysis and particularly prominent in emotion classification where multiple emotion categories are very likely to produce naturally skewed training data. Different sampling methods have been proposed to improve classification performance by reducing the imbalance ratio between training classes. However, data sparseness and the small disjunct problem remain obstacles in generating new samples for minority classes when the data are skewed and limited. Methods to produce meaningful samples for smaller classes rather than simple duplication are essential in overcoming this problem. In this paper, we present an oversampling method based on word embedding compositionality which produces meaningful balanced training data. We first use a large corpus to train a continuous skip-gram model to form a word embedding model maintaining the syntactic and semantic integrity of the word features. Then, a compositional algorithm based on recursive neural tensor networks is used to construct sentence vectors based on the word embedding model. Finally, we use the SMOTE algorithm as an oversampling method to generate samples for the minority classes and produce a fully balanced training set. Evaluation results on two quite different tasks show that the feature composition method and the oversampling method are both important in obtaining improved classification results. Our method effectively addresses the data imbalance issue and consequently achieves improved results for both sentiment and emotion classification. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Emotion classification; Imbalanced training; Semantic compositionality; Sentiment analysis; Word embedding,Data mining; Semantics; Text processing; Classification performance; Classification results; Compositionality; Emotion classification; Sentiment analysis; Skewed training datum; Text classification; Word embedding; Classification (of information),2-s2.0-84939941491

As endogenous factors, we consider returns and volatility, whereas the exogenous factors are the total daily number of news articles and a semantic variable based on a sentiment analysis of the news. Linear regression and partial correlation analysis of the data show that different categories of investors are differently correlated to these factors. Governmental and non-profit organizations are weakly sensitive to news and returns or volatility, and, typically, they are more correlated with the former than with the latter. Households and companies, on the contrary, are very sensitive to both endogenous and exogenous factors, and volatility and returns are, on average, much more relevant than the number of news articles and sentiment, respectively. Financial institutions and foreign organizations are intermediate between these two cases, in terms of both the total explanatory power of these factors and their relative importance. We explicitly consider the role of overnight news and overnight returns on the successive trading activity and trading balance of the different categories of investors. We observe the role of the overnight news, which is weaker than the ones observed between synchronous variables. By performing a vector autoregression (VAR) analysis, we show that the flux of news of the previous day affects the trading activity of companies, households and foreign investors and the dynamics of volatility.

Factors that impact SE beliefs could then be explored. Design/methodology/approach – Using the definition of sustainability from the Brundtland report and expectancy value theory, students’ sentiment toward SE was evaluated using items to assess SE self-efficacy, SE value and SE affect. The survey was distributed at three diverse universities with 515 responses from students ranging from first year through graduate studies in a variety of engineering majors. The survey instrument was validated using principal components analysis, and internal reliability was established via high Cronbach’s alpha for each construct. Findings – Participation in more experiential, enriching learning experiences correlated to higher SE self-efficacy, value and affect. Extracurricular club involvement correlated with a lower self-efficacy but high SE value.

On the generative side, we explore the expressive capabilities of an abstract, faceless, creature-like robot, with very few degrees of freedom, lacking both facial expressions and the complex humanoid design found often in emotionally expressive robots. We validate our system in a series of experiments: in one study, we find an advantage in classification for animated vs static affect expressions and advantages in valence and arousal estimation and personal preference ratings for both animated vs static and physical vs on-screen expressions. In a second experiment, we show that our parametrically generated expression variables correlate with the intended user affect perception.

In 2012 about 14.1 million new cases of cancer occurred globally. Because of many reasons like the severity of some cases, the side effects of some treatments and death of other patients, cancer patients tend to be affected by serious emotional disorders, like depression, for instance. Thus, monitoring the mood of the patients is an important part of their treatment. Many cancer patients are users of online social networks and many of them take part in cancer virtual communities where they exchange messages commenting about their treatment or giving support to other patients in the community. Most of these communities are of public access and thus are useful sources of information about the mood of patients. Based on that, Sentiment Analysis methods can be useful to automatically detect positive or negative mood of cancer patients by analyzing their messages in these online communities. Objective: The objective of this work is to present a Sentiment Analysis tool, named SentiHealth-Cancer (SHC-pt), that improves the detection of emotional state of patients in Brazilian online cancer communities, by inspecting their posts written in Portuguese language. The SHC-pt is a sentiment analysis tool which is tailored specifically to detect positive, negative or neutral messages of patients in online communities of cancer patients. We conducted a comparative study of the proposed method with a set of general-purpose sentiment analysis tools adapted to this context. Methods: Different collections of posts were obtained from two cancer communities in Facebook. Additionally, the posts were analyzed by sentiment analysis tools that support the Portuguese language (Semantria and SentiStrength) and by the tool SHC-pt, developed based on the method proposed in this paper called SentiHealth. Moreover, as a second alternative to analyze the texts in Portuguese, the collected texts were automatically translated into English, and submitted to sentiment analysis tools that do not support the Portuguese language (AlchemyAPI and Textalytics) and also to Semantria and SentiStrength, using the English option of these tools. Six experiments were conducted with some variations and different origins of the collected posts. The results were measured using the following metrics: precision, recall, F1-measure and accuracy. Results: The proposed tool SHC-pt reached the best averages for accuracy and F1-measure (harmonic mean between recall and precision) in the three sentiment classes addressed (positive, negative and neutral) in all experimental settings. Moreover, the worst accuracy value (58%) achieved by SHC-pt in any experiment is 11.53% better than the greatest accuracy (52%) presented by other addressed tools. Finally, the worst average F1 (48.46%) reached by SHC-pt in any experiment is 4.14% better than the greatest average F1 (46.53%) achieved by other addressed tools. Thus, even when we compare the SHC-pt results in complex scenario versus others in easier scenario the SHC-pt is better. Conclusions: This paper presents two contributions. First, it proposes the method SentiHealth to detect the mood of cancer patients that are also users of communities of patients in online social networks. Second, it presents an instantiated tool from the method, called SentiHealth-Cancer (SHC-pt), dedicated to automatically analyze posts in communities of cancer patients, based on SentiHealth. This context-tailored tool outperformed other general-purpose sentiment analysis tools at least in the cancer context. This suggests that the SentiHealth method could be instantiated as other disease-based tools during future works, for instance SentiHealth-HIV, SentiHealth-Stroke and SentiHealth-Sclerosis. © 2015.",Cancer; Facebook; Online social networks; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis,Complex networks; Computational linguistics; Data mining; Diseases; Online systems; Patient treatment; Virtual reality; Websites; Cancer; Facebook; On-line social networks; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); accuracy; Article; Brazil; cancer patient; cancer research; clinical assessment tool; comparative study; emotion; evaluation study; human; interpersonal communication; mood; online monitoring; outcome assessment; priority journal; sentihealth cancer; social network; affect; Internet; neoplasm; psychology; social support; Affect; Humans; Internet; Neoplasms; Social Support,2-s2.0-84951011189

We analyze a corpus comprising nearly 60,000 such reviews with a state-of-the-art probabilistic model of text. We describe a probabilistic generative model that captures latent sentiment across aspects of care (eg, interpersonal manner). We target specific aspects by leveraging a small set of manually annotated reviews. We perform regression analysis to assess whether model output improves correlation with state-level measures of healthcare. We report both qualitative and quantitative results. Model output correlates with state-level measures of quality healthcare, including patient likelihood of visiting their primary care physician within 14 days of discharge (p=0.03), and using the proposed model better predicts this outcome (p=0.10). We find similar results for healthcare expenditure. Generative models of text can recover important information from online physician reviews, facilitating large-scale analyses of such reviews.

Hence, identification of opinion leaders has receive recent attention. Specifically, discovering opinion leaders in a Web-based stock message board might be valuable for many investors. Current methods for finding opinion leaders mainly concentrate on a graph of user connections, and thus leads to large amount of computation. On the other hand, opinions in user message are usually ignored so that the effectiveness in finding opinion leaders is very limited. In the paper, a new method is proposed to recognize opinion leaders in Web-based stock message boards. We combine clustering algorithm and sentiment analysis to address the two problems in current methods. Features of user activities are calculated based on messages posted on the board, then clustering algorithm is applied to the user data and generate clusters which contain potential opinion leaders. Next, we employ sentiment analysis to candidates and associate the sentiment with the actual price movement trend. By this means, opinion leaders can be well discovered since good ability in analyzing stock market is considered as skills of Influential users.

This study aimed to characterise and compare the use of ""Twitter"" by five prominent organisations in surgery. Study Design: Data were collected from Twitter and the scale, reach, nature and sentiment of messages analysed. Message influence was determined and content analysed by frequency and association using hierarchical clustering and network analysis. Poisson regression was used to compare institutional message and ""re-tweet"" counts. Results: 7712 messages were analysed from a four-year period up to 13th April 2013. The American College of Surgeons (ACS) had tweeted most and posted the greatest number of messages per day (3.3/day). The number of followers reflects social reach and the Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCSEng) had the greatest number (11,600) followed by the ACS (7320). The number of ""retweets"" a message receives is a measure of influence with the RCSEng (2.0) demonstrating a significantly greater count than the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland (RCSI; 0.8, p<0.001) and the ACS (1.3, p<0.001). Followers of the RCSEng and ACS appeared most influential. Terms relating to education feature prominently in messages posted by the RCSEng and RCSEd, but less so in those from the RCSI and ACS. Education and training terms were highly correlated with ""events"". Conclusions: Surgical colleges have significant international reach through social media. UK colleges frequently communicate about education/training opportunities while the ACS focuses on patient-related matters.

To understand how much consumers search for such information online on one Internet search engine, whether they mention such information in social media and how positively they view this information. Setting and design: A leading Internet search engine (Google) was the main focus of the study. Google Trends and Google Adwords keyword analyses were performed for national and Californian searches between 1 August 2012 and 31 July 2013 for keywords related to 'top hospital' , best hospital', and 'hospital quality ', as well as for six specific hospital quality reports. Separately, a proprietary social media monitoring tool was used to investigate blog, forum, social media and traditional media mentions of, and sentiment towards, major public reports of hospital quality in California in 2012. Primary outcome measures: (1) Counts of searches for keywords performed on Google; (2) counts of and (3) sentiment of mentions of public reports on social media. Results: National Google search volume for 75 hospital quality-related terms averaged 610 700 searches per month with strong variation by keyword and by state. A commercial report (Healthgrades) was more commonly searched for nationally on Google than the federal government's Hospital Compare, which otherwise dominated quality-related search terms. Social media references in California to quality reports were generally few, and commercially produced hospital quality reports were more widely mentioned than state (Office of Statewide Healthcare Planning and Development (OSHPD)), or non-profit (CalHospitalCompare) reports. Conclusions: Consumers are somewhat aware of hospital quality based on Internet search activity and social media disclosures. Public stakeholders may be able to broaden their quality dissemination initiatives by advertising on Google or Twitter and using social media interactively with consumers looking for relevant information.",,"algorithm; article; consumer; government; health care quality; health care system; hospital; human; Internet; patient safety; patient satisfaction; public hospital; scoring system; search engine; social media; United States; awareness; California; information dissemination; information seeking; Internet; public hospital; research; search engine; standards; Awareness; California; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Information Dissemination; Information Seeking Behavior; Internet; Quality of Health Care; Research Report; Search Engine; Social Media; United States",2-s2.0-84897538977

Our study is motivated by the preferred statistical attributes of SD analysis. Specifically, SD requires no normal distribution of returns assumption and it imposes few restrictions on investors' risk-return tradeoff preference. Our results indicate that the Ramadan effect exists in most of Muslim countries used in the study during the sub-periods 1996-2000 and 2001-2006 and in the portfolio during the sub-period 1995-2007. However, its magnitude diminishes during the global financial crisis period (2007-2012). The findings of this paper indicate that previous results are not an artifact deriving from violations of distributional assumptions.

We present around 400 VACs automatically mined from million- scale real user comments associated with images in social media. Furthermore, we propose an automatic visual based approach to predict VACs by first detecting publisher affect concepts in image content and then applying statistical correlations between such publisher affect concepts and the VACs. We demonstrate major benefits of the proposed methods in several real-world tasks - recommending images to invoke certain target VACs among viewers, increasing the accuracy of predicting VACs by 20.1% and finally developing a social assistant tool that may suggest plausible, content- specific and desirable comments when users view new images.

Those reactions reveal the subjective perception of the event and extend its understanding. This has motivated us to develop a system to explore and visualize volume, patterns, and trends of user sentiments as they evolve over time. Previous work in sentiment analysis and opinion mining has addressed these issues. But the majority of them distinguish only two polarity categories, leaving a more detailed and insightful analysis to be desired. In this paper, we suggest using a finegrained, multi-category emotion model to classify and visualize users' emotional reactions in public events. We describe EmotionWatch, a tool that constructs visual summaries of public emotions, and apply it to the 2012 Olympics as a test case. We report findings from a user study evaluating the usability of the tool and validating the emotion model. Results show that users prefer a more detailed inspection of public emotions over the simplified analysis. Despite its complexity, users were able to effectively grasp, understand, and interpret the emotional reactions using EmotionWatch. The same user study also pointed out few design improvements for the future development of analogous systems.

Employing functional data analysis, we treat the curve of prerelease buzz evolution trajectory as the unit of analysis and find that the shape of the curve significantly adds power in predicting new product performance compared with using product characteristics and firm advertising alone. Moreover, daily prerelease buzz evolution data enable accurate sales forecasting long before product release, which allows sufficient time for managers to adjust product design and/or marketing strategy. For example, the forecasting accuracy using an early buzz evolution curve ending on the 61st day before product release is not only higher than that using accumulated buzz volume until then but also higher than that using the total volume of all buzz up until product release. Beyond the sales outcome, we find that prerelease buzz is quickly reflected in firm stock returns before product release and reduces the absolute amount of postrelease stock price correction. The model accounts for endogeneity, and the results are robust after controlling for buzz sentiment. We also explore the factors influencing prerelease buzz evolution patterns, thus generating insights into how to manage prerelease buzz dynamics to enhance new product performance. © 2014 INFORMS.",Evolution pattern; Forecasting; Functional data analysis; New product sales; Prerelease buzz dynamics; Stock market value,,2-s2.0-84901024649

We claim that an argumentation analysis is needed, including opinion summarization, sentiment score prediction, and others. Since existing language resources to drive such research are missing, we have designed the ArguAna TripAdvisor corpus, which compiles 2,100 manually annotated hotel reviews balanced with respect to the reviews' sentiment scores. Each review text is segmented into facts, positive, and negative opinions, while all hotel aspects and amenities are marked. In this paper, we present the design and a first study of the corpus.

In this paper, we show that a SVM classifier combined with a cluster ensemble can offer better classification accuracies than a stand-alone SVM. In our study, we employed an algorithm, named C3E-SL, capable to combine classifier and cluster ensembles. This algorithm can refine tweet classifications from additional information provided by clusterers, assuming that similar instances from the same clusters are more likely to share the same class label.

To this end, most existing methods mainly focus on analyzing the textual information. This has faced huge difficulty as nowadays users are more likely to express their feelings in a hybrid manner not only with texts, but also with images. It is therefore essential to take images into account. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-media Bag-of-words Model (CBM) for Microblog sentiment analysis. In this model, we represent the text and image of a Weibo tweet as a unified Bag-of-words representation. Based on this model, we use Logistic Regression to classify the Microblog sentiment. It performs well in the sentiment classification task since it doesn't require the conditional dependence assumption. We also use SVM and Naïve Bayes to make a comparison. Experiments on 5,000 Microblog messages demonstrate that our CBM model performs better than text-based methods. The sentiment classification accuracy on Microblog messages of our model is 80%, improved by 4% than the text-based methods.

For example, Facebook offers a service allowing marketers to utilize users' posts to automatically generate advertisements. The effectiveness of this practice depends on the ability to accurately predict a post's influence on its readers. For an advertising strategy of this nature, the influence of a post is determined jointly by the features of the post, such as contents and time of creation, and the features of the author of the post. We propose two models for predicting the influence of a post using both sources of influence, post- and author-related features, as predictors. An empirical evaluation shows that the proposed predictive features improve prediction accuracy, and the models are effective in predicting the influence score. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Data mining; Electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM); Influence; Sentiment analysis; Social network,Social networking (online); Electronic wordof-mouth (eWOM); Influence; Sentiment analysis; Data mining,2-s2.0-84916196336

Based on the belief that nationalism plays a vital role in cementing the process of recovery by making survivors believe that they, after all, have a new opportunity to be on feet again.Design/methodology/approach – The visual methodology (enrooted in the analysis of content) is the chosen technique to develop five indicators which replicates the nationalist sentiment of Chileans post-disaster context. The archetype of nationalism is activated whenever the community is in danger.Findings – As Baudrillard put it, the post-modernity is witness of a much wider nation-state’s declination. Nonetheless, current information presented in this report very well contrasts a thesis of this caliber. Far-away of being experiencing a decrease of Nationalism, we argue that in contexts of emergency and chaos, nationality plays an important role to maintain a firm bondage and prevent social fragmentation. Five indicators are found in the discourse of Chile helps Chile, beautiness, sport, coercion, stratification and materiality.Research limitations/implications – The outcome of this research, because of its qualitative nature, does not allows statistical or broader inferences. For this, further investigation is needed.Originality/value – Much of disaster-related texts have been influenced by Jean Baudrillard and his thesis of nation state decline. The originality of this research shows the opposite. As a process of resiliency, the national being still plays a crucial role in revitalizing the social tenets of community in context of uncertainness. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.

Sentiment extracted from Twitter was less accurate in capturing mean levels of support for the two major candidates and, in particular, showed a strong negativity bias against the incumbent president. Twitter sentiment did mirror regional trends in the polling and election results though not as strongly as seen for mention counts.

Instead, it is more useful to determine specifically which aspects of the products/services the users are happy or unhappy about.

Further developing this story, we compare and contrast recent 'policy reform' recommendations proposed in both countries with the aim of stimulating institutional investment in housebuilding.Although impediments to large-scale institutional funding for rental housing remain substantial, we conclude that, should it take off, such financing could significantly affect the structure and quality of provision - especially via the involvement of not-for-profit landlords. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",housing policy; institutional investment; private rental housing,homeowner; housing conditions; housing policy; housing provision; institutional framework; investment; policy approach; policy making; tenure relations; Australia; United Kingdom,2-s2.0-84889248031

As the number of reviews expands, it is essential to develop an efficient sentiment analysis model that is capable of extracting product aspects and determining the sentiments for aspects. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised model for detecting aspects in reviews. In this model, first a generalized method is proposed to learn multi-word aspects. Second, a set of heuristic rules is employed to take into account the influence of an opinion word on detecting the aspect. Third a new metric based on mutual information and aspect frequency is proposed to score aspects with a new bootstrapping iterative algorithm. The presented bootstrapping algorithm works with an unsupervised seed set. Finally two pruning methods based on the relations between aspects in reviews are presented to remove incorrect aspects. The proposed model does not require labeled training data and can be applicable to other languages or domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a collection of product reviews dataset, where it outperforms other techniques. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",aspect detection; opinion mining; review mining; sentiment analysis,Bootstrapping algorithm; Hot research topics; Iterative algorithm; Labeled training data; Opinion mining; Products and services; Sentiment analysis; User-generated content; Information systems; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Data mining,2-s2.0-84884951221

Most state-of-the-art solutions essentially rely on frequencies of sentiment-carrying words (e.g., taken from a lexicon) when analyzing the sentiment conveyed by natural language text. These approaches ignore the structural aspects of a document, which contain valuable information. Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) provides important information about the relative importance of the different text spans in a document. This knowledge could be useful for sentiment analysis and polarity classification. However, RST has only been studied for polarity classification problems in constrained and small scale scenarios. The main objective of this paper is to explore the usefulness of RST in large-scale polarity ranking of blog posts. We apply sentence-level methods to select the key sentences that convey the overall on-topic sentiment of a blog post. Then, we apply RST analysis to these core sentences in order to guide the classification of their polarity and thus to generate an overall estimation of the document's polarity with respect to a specific topic. Our results show that RST provides valuable information about the discourse structure of the texts that can be used to make a more accurate ranking of documents in terms of their estimated sentiment in multi-topic blogs. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Blog; Discourse Structure; Opinion Mining; Polarity Estimation; Rhetorical Structure Theory; Sentiment Analysis,Blog; Discourse structure; Opinion mining; Polarity estimation; Rhetorical structure theory; Sentiment analysis; Data mining; Estimation; Information retrieval systems; Information systems; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Blogs,2-s2.0-84884933367

Relevant feature extraction is the foremost problem in the preprocessing stage. SentiWordNet is an ontology that includes numeric scores related to the positive or negative aspects of the words. The work in this paper explores the use of SentiWordNet to extract sentiment features of the words in the song lyrics. The experiments are carried out on a collection of 185 lyrics each belonging to one of the four classes. Three classification algorithms namely, Naïve Bayesian (NB), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) using six measures for attribute relevance analysis namely, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Chi-Square (CS), Information Gain (IG), GINI Index (GI) and Gain Ratio (GR) have been applied to model the classifiers. The experiments examine the relevance of the sentiment features for classification. The ratio of the positive and negative scores, normalized ratio, and average of the positive and negative scores are three sentiment features. The experimental results indicate that the Naïve Bayesian classifier using the average of the positive and negative score as sentiment feature, and gain ratio as feature selection criteria achieve 78.27% accuracy based on top 10% of the features.

Roughly halfway through the survey's data collection, millions of Latinos mobilized to protest HR 4437, an immigration bill advancing in the U.S. Congress. This event provides the opportunity to examine differences in self-identification among comparable populations. I divide the LNS into a control group interviewed prior to these demonstrations and a treatment group interviewed after. My analysis shows respondents in the latter group were more likely to identify as American, with effects concentrated among Spanish speakers, and particularly Mexicans and Dominicans. I find no difference in identification as Latino or with one's ancestral subgroup.

Purpose: Latina mothers will identify the barriers and opportunities for physical activity for Latino children in West Columbia SC and propose policy recommendations. Methods: This is a qualitative pilot study with 12 Latina mothers using Photovoice to identify barriers and opportunities for physical activity for their children. Community stakeholder and school staff interviews (eight) also were conducted. Latinas discussed the data collected and developed potential solutions to the problems. Data collection and analysis took place in the city of West Columbia during 2010-2011. Content analysis of focus groups and interview transcripts were conducted using descriptive qualitative coding techniques. Results: Latina mothers positively described their neighborhoods as their homes but also identified several environmental barriers to physical activity including lack of transportation, not being able to speak English, lack of knowledge of their children's opportunities at school, and feelings of discrimination due to anti-immigration sentiments in the state. Mothers also proposed to improve their family diets, advocate for better equipment in public parks, building of community sidewalks, and increasing neighborhood police presence. Conclusions: Latina mothers demonstrated knowledge about factors related to childhood obesity and proposed solutions to the problems and worked to organize their communities to present alternatives to policymakers.

Twitter is one such social media where opinions expressed play a significant influence on the marketability of a product. Hence, an accurate method for predicting sentiments could enable us to understand customers' preferences, their views on the product and services offered by the companies. These have the potential to create positive or negative wave in the market. Hence, this information is valuable for both companies and consumers. Enterprises can leverage this information for formalizing their strategies.

We developed a metric, referred to as the Endorsement Ratio (ERo), to explore the feasibility of quantifying the sentiment expressed by opioid abusers who post online about prescription opioid products. Methods: Internet posts written between April 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011 and related to six prescription opioid compounds (oxycodone ER, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, morphine ER, and tramadol) were identified and qualitatively coded. A mixed effects multinomial logistic regression was employed to model the probability of observing endorsing, discouraging, mixed, or unclear messages per compound. Endorsement-to-discouragement ratio (ERo) and ratio of endorsement-to-discouragement ratios (RERo) were estimated for each compound. Results: In the study sample of 12838 Internet posts, a ranking of endorsement could be established, with oxymorphone as most endorsed (ERo=7.39), followed by hydromorphone (ERo=5.02), hydrocodone (ERo=3.53), oxycodone ER (ERo=3.23), morphine ER (ERo=2.71), and tramadol (ERo=1.76). Relative rankings of products required that route of administration be considered. Conclusions: This study expands existing Internet monitoring approaches by developing a metric to estimate the endorsement of specific prescription opioid compounds as viewed through the lens of Internet communities. Route of administration must be taken into account when examining preferences of drug abusers for various products. This study did not assess whether the novel metric is valid with respect to classification of abuse rates of different drugs.

It also helps news consumers explore public reaction on articles relevant to a topic and refine their exploration via related entities, topics, articles and tweets. Given a topic, e.g., ""Gulf Oil Spill,"" or ""The Arab Spring"", MAQSA combines three key dimensions: time, geographic location, and topic to generate a detailed activity dashboard around relevant articles. The dashboard contains an annotated comment timeline and a social graph of comments. It utilizes commenters' locations to build maps of comment sentiment and topics by region of the world. Finally, to facilitate exploration, MAQSA provides listings of related entities, articles, and tweets. It algorithmically processes large collections of articles and tweets, and enables the dynamic specification of topics and dates for exploration. In this demo, participants will be invited to explore the social dynamics around articles on oil spills, the Libyan revolution, and the Arab Spring. In addition, participants will be able to define and explore their own topics dynamically. © 2012 ACM.",interactive exploration; sentiment analysis; social media,Dynamic specifications; Geographic location; Interactive exploration; Key dimensions; News articles; Sentiment analysis; Social activities; Social dynamics; Social graphs; Social media; User engagement; Oil spills; Marine pollution,2-s2.0-84862703818

The specific method is applied for the first time in a peripheral and illiquid market as the Athens Exchange.The empirical findings of this paper show that the proposed volatility index includes information about future realized volatility beyond that contained in past volatility. In addition, our analysis indicates that there is a statistically significant negative and asymmetric contemporaneous relationship between the returns of the implied volatility index and the underlying equity index.

It explores how these colonial policies of forced expulsion that were used to contain anti-colonial political activity unintentionally enabled political exiles to create new trans-imperial networks of resistance. From the late 1800s, the British Colonial Government exiled to Seychelles over 500 anti-colonial leaders and their followers from Egypt, Somaliland, Ethiopia, Gold Coast, Palestine and other colonies; the last political exile was Greek Cypriot leader Archbishop Makarios who arrived in Seychelles in 1956. Based on archival and empirical research this paper examines their experiences of exile and how, despite feelings of loss and isolation, they continued to challenge colonial authority by mobilising new forms of contestation. Through a colonial geographical imaginary, Seychelles was constructed as distant, remote and isolated, a place where political agitators could be safely confined and prevented from infecting others with their anti-colonial sentiments. Instead, however, these movements brought colonised people together from across the empire and created spatially extended networks of ideas that became significant in connecting these 'remote' islands to other places. Exiles disrupted the authority of the British Colonial Government through mundane and small acts of resistance in which they made constant, almost daily, demands for their right to return home and better living conditions. This study, on a much under-researched form of imperial mobility and confinement, contributes to debates on colonialism, space and resistance by identifying networks produced by colonised people and, through an exploration of translocal subaltern agency and resistance, confounds place-bound notions of politics. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Anti-colonial resistance; Colonialism; Political exiles; Seychelles,colonialism; Commonwealth of Nations; government; historical perspective; imperialism; mobility; nationalism; spatial analysis; Indian Ocean,2-s2.0-84864016443

The analysis suggests that junior academic staff perceive the academic workplace as reasonably positive and supportive. In addition to relatively high levels of satisfaction, institutional support and remuneration, the findings suggest that there are minimal substantive differences in levels of work and work patterns between junior and more senior academic staff, a finding at odds with the general literature and common sentiment, which suggests junior staff work longer hours.

These subjectivity clues are frequently used in community questions and are useful for opinion question analysis. This paper introduces a principled approach to constructing an opinion lexicon for community-based question answering (cQA) services. We formulate the opinion lexicon induction as a semi-supervised learning task in the graph context. Our method makes use of existing opinion words to extract new opinion entities (slang and urban words/phrases) from community questions. It then models the opinion entities in a graph context to learn the polarity of the new opinion entities based on the graph connectivity information. In contrast to previous approaches, our method not only learns such polarities from the labeled data but also from the unlabeled data and is more feasible in the web context where the dictionary-based relations (such as synonym, antonym, or hyponym) between most words are not available for constructing a high quality graph. The experiments show that our approach is effective both in terms of the quality of the discovered new opinion entities as well as its ability in inferring their polarity. Furthermore, since the value of opinion lexicons lies in their usefulness in applications, we show the utility of the constructed lexicon in the sentiment classification task.

Previous studies in financial market prediction mainly focus on financial and economic indicators. Web information, as an information repository, has been used in customer relationship management and recommendation, but it is rarely considered to be useful in financial market prediction. In this paper, a combined web mining and sentiment analysis method is proposed to forecast financial markets using web information. In the proposed method, a spider is firstly employed to crawl tweets from Twitter. Secondly, Opinion Finder is offered to mining the online sentiments hidden in tweets. Thirdly, some new sentiment indicators are suggested and a stochastic time effective function (STEF) is introduced to integrate everyday sentiments. Fourthly, support vector regressions (SVRs) are used to model the relationship between online sentiments and financial market prices. Finally, the selective model can be serviced for financial market prediction. To validate the proposed method, Standard and Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) is used for evaluation. The empirical results show that our proposed forecasting method outperforms the traditional forecasting methods, and meanwhile, the proposed method can also capture individual behavior in financial market quickly and easily.

Second, by conceptually distinguishing between ""young people"" (as an age category) and ""youth"" (as a social category), this chapter postulates that ""youth movements"" are not necessarily about political change, but are essentially about ""claiming youthfulness."" The political efficacy of youth movements depends to a large extent on the capacity of the adversaries-the political and moral authority-to accommodate the claims of youthfulness. © 2010 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

Network members are a source of support and may be designated as the patient's surrogate therapeutic decision maker. However, little is known about the role of caregivers regarding highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and adherence to medication, especially among low income and medically underserved HIV-infected individuals. The objective of this analysis was to explore patients and their caregivers' understanding, insight, and perceptions of HAART. This was a qualitative study conducted in an urban teaching hospital in the Bronx, NY, consisting of 144 adults with advanced HIV/AIDS and their informal/familial caregivers. Patients and caregivers completed in-depth interviews and brief questionnaires. The data were analyzed using standard qualitative techniques. Themes related to HAART efficacy, side effects, and adherence were identified in the discussions with both patients and their care providers. Looking for consistencies and discordant reports of patients-caregivers dyadic experience with HAART and their association with healthcare sentiment, it was found that the accounts of both members of the dyad were more likely to reflect positive feelings about the patient's healthcare experience when they shared perceptions about the treatment, and were more likely to have a negative viewpoint when the dyad was discordant about treatment. These findings support the importance for HIV healthcare providers to include both patients and their caregivers in discussions about HAART, in order to improve their understanding of and satisfaction with the medication, and, to ultimately contribute to patients' adherence. The study also suggests that healthcare teams may enhance dialog with patients and caregivers to create therapeutic decisions to accommodate the priorities and values of the patient and their family.

Many programs at the federal and territorial levels now exist to support projects ranging from basic research and development of teaching materials to radio and television programming. The commitment to Aboriginal language revitalization expressed by the territorial government has also generated interest in First Nations cultures by a non-Native public, as demonstrated by such popular events as the Commissioner's Potlatch and the Yukon International Storytelling Festival. What distinguishes Yukon language revitalization efforts from other endeavors is that many of these initiatives have been jointly conceptualized and guided by government agencies, language and culture ""experts,"" and Aboriginal peoples. The Canadian government (federal and territorial) has been consciously shifting its policy away from social and political dependence of Aboriginal peoples and toward First Nations' self-determination and self-government. This translates into an attempt to have Aboriginal direction in government programs and services. In language planning, this collaboration has resulted in the emergence and institutionalization of a territory-wide language ideology. This chapter explores the development of this potentially "" counterhegemonic"" collaboration. Those involved in language revitalization often consider the first step toward reversal to be the assessment of language loss. To assist in assessment Joshua Fishman created the Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (GIDS), a scale of linguistic degradation ranging from no intergenerational transmission to contexts where the threatened language predominates. Fishman linked government with his last two stages of disruption: Stage 2, where language X is used ""in lower governmental services and mass media but not in the higher spheres of either,"" and Stage 1, where there is ""some use of [language X] in higher level educational, occupational, governmental and media efforts (but without the additional safety provided by political independence)"" (1991:105, 107). Languages at these stages are less disrupted than at any other stage. However, Fishman remarked that these ""lower"" and ""higher"" levels of government are the most closely regulated by existing regimes ""because of their importance in the formation and preservation of integrative attitudes, opinions, identities and the topmost skills and statuses"" (1991:106). This sentiment, and ""hegemony"" in general, have been central concerns of the emerging language ideological literature on dominant language ideologies (e.g., see Briggs 1998; House 2002; Kroskrity 1998, 2000c; Silverstein 1998b). This suggests that any dominant bureaucratic institution will closely monitor the incorporation of alternative voices into its programs and rhetoric, including language planning and the conceptualization of language. The language situation in the Yukon provides an interesting case study because of the government's explicit commitment to the integration of First Nations voices, the modification of its own bureaucratic rhetoric and practices as a result, and its mandate to transfer the control of and responsibility for certain institutions, through self-governing agreements, to the First Nations. Because of this collaboration, we might predict that First Nations people in the Yukon will have had a greater influence on the ideologization of their languages and language more generally, including at ""lower"" and ""higher"" governmental levels. The final analysis will be made when the full transfer of government control, or ""devolution,"" has occurred. What we can see as the transfers take place is evidence of Aboriginal self-determination through the transformation of the state's discourse about Aboriginal languages. In this chapter I examine the language ideological dimensions of the institutional changes both historically and discursively, especially through themes articulated in government publications such as legislation, program reports, evaluations, project proposals, and notes from language meetings. The first section of this chapter presents the historical precursors of language revitalization in the Yukon, culminating in the Yukon Languages Act, the creation of Aboriginal Language Services, and the Yukon Aboriginal Languages Conference. The second section describes the conference itself, the ideological themes represented in speeches by participants, and the implications of its motto, ""We Are Our Language."" The third section discusses the dialogic nature of these conceptualizations of language and the ways in which they build upon each other. As mentioned above, territorial and national administrators created a forum for Aboriginal people and experts to collaboratively produce a unique, Yukon-centered language revitalization approach. In studying this approach we see how the dialogic construction of a language ideology relates to the state's attempts to redistribute its power through the inclusion of Aboriginal voices and the mediated, partial transfer of institutional control. © 2009 by University of Arizona Press.

It proposes a phenomenological analysis of upward social mobility, looking particularly at the way in which upwardly mobile persons deal with the tension between their group of origin and their new group. The main argument is that a moral imperative to 'pay back to society' structures the experience of a sharp change in class and status. The specificity of the experience of upward social mobility in the Indian context seems to be that it is not characterised by a tendency to forget the group of origin in order to better acculturate to the new group, nor is it characterised by feelings of 'being ashamed' of the group of origin, and even less by a sentiment of 'guilt' about abandoning this group. On the contrary, the perpetuation of a link with the group of origin (i.e., the caste group) seems to completely shape the experience of mobility. After showing that the basis of this particular ethos of mobility is caste, the article ends with a discussion of the way in which caste renders it difficult to define social mobility in the Indian context.",,acculturation; caste system; class; mobility; social structure; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia,2-s2.0-61349198312

For each product class we first automatically extract general features (characteristics describing any product, such as price, size, design), for each product we then extract specific features (as picture resolution in the case of a digital camera) and feature attributes (adjectives grading the characteristics, as for example high or low for price, small or big for size and modern or faddy for design). Further on, we assign a polarity (positive or negative) to each of the feature attributes using a previously annotated corpus and Support Vector Machines Sequential Minimal Optimization[1] machine learning with the Normalized Google Distance[2]. We show how the method presented is employed to build a feature-driven opinion summarization system that is presently working in English and Spanish. In order to detect the product category, we use a modified system for person names classification. The raw review text is split into sentences and depending on the product class detected, only the phrases containing the specific product features are selected for further processing. The phrases extracted undergo a process of anaphora resolution, Named Entity Recognition and syntactic parsing. Applying syntactic dependency and part of speech patterns, we extract pairs containing the feature and the polarity of the feature attribute the customer associates to the feature in the review. Eventually, we statistically summarize the polarity of the opinions different customers expressed about the product on the web as percentages of positive and negative opinions about each of the product features. We show the results and improvements over baseline, together with a discussion on the strong and weak points of the method and the directions for future work. ©2008 IEEE.",Normalized google distance; Opinion mining; Summarization; SVM machine learning,Anaphora resolution; Customer review; Feature-based; Machine-learning; Named entity recognition; Normalized google distance; Normalized Google distances; Opinion mining; Part Of Speech; Picture resolution; Product categories; Product class; Product feature; Sentiment analysis; Sequential minimal optimization; Summarization; Summarization systems; SVM machine learning; Syntactic parsing; Weak points; Cameras; Computational linguistics; Customer satisfaction; Information retrieval systems; Internet; Knowledge engineering; Mining; Natural language processing systems; Robot learning; Sales; Security of data; Sequential machines; Support vector machines; Syntactics; Feature extraction,2-s2.0-67650345726

The natural language processing community has become increasingly interested in detecting, through automatic means, the expression of opinions and measuring the intensity of emotions held by the writer. Despite the depth and abstraction often associated with expressions of sentiment, we apply strictly lexical analysis to the opinions expressed about books and find that machine learning techniques are capable of resolving even fine-grained distinctions between opinions. Using an averaged perceptron classifier trained using a word subsequence kernel, we achieve an accuracy of 89% when distinguishing between 1- and 5-star reviews. Further, this same model yields significant separation when scoring intermediate reviews - making distinctions even human annotators find difficult. We detail the collection of data for supervised training and present the results of our sentiment classifier along with some discussion about why we believe this approach to be effective. © 2007 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Classifiers; Computational linguistics; Data storage equipment; Information theory; Learning algorithms; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Separation; Averaged Perceptron; International conferences; Lexical analysis; Machine-learning techniques; Model yields; NAtural language processing; Supervised training; Learning systems,2-s2.0-47749085083
"Panayiotou G., Papageorgiou M.","Depressed mood: The role of negative thoughts, self-consciousness, and sex role stereotypes",2007,International Journal of Psychology,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34748844489&doi=10.1080%2f00207590701318389&partnerID=40&md5=a0289383360de1c3b50b74cfc11be7a4,"Research typically finds that depression is twice as common among women as among men. This may relate to differences in socialization that result in different emotions, cognitions, and coping reactions. Sex-role stereotypes, employment and marital status, and differential social pressures may also be significant in making women more vulnerable to the development of depression. Women may have less decision-making power, face more adverse life events, and have limited access to resources, which may lead to feelings of helplessness and low self-esteem. Low self-esteem and negative cognitions about the self in turn may be proximal factors predictive of negative mood. Additionally, women may be more prone to ruminative self-focus rather than active coping, a significant risk factor for depression. This study examined individual predictors of depressed mood for each sex, including coping, self-esteem, negative thoughts, self-consciousness (rumination), as well as social factors such as the endorsement of sex-role stereotypes and decision-making power in the family. Results indicated that social factors were not related to depressed mood in either sex, but were related to coping styles and self-esteem. Depressed mood was associated with individual characteristics, such as avoidant coping styles, social anxiety for women, and ruminative self-focus for men. Regression analysis showed that coping through denial and negative thoughts explained depressed mood, and the latter was particularly true for men. These results point to the significance of examining both individual and social factors when attempting to understand depression in men and women. La recherche trouve typiquement que la dpression est deux fois plus commune chez les femmes que chez les hommes. Ceci pourrait tre reli aux diffrences dans la socialisation qui pourraient entraner diverses motions, cognitions et ractions d'adaptation. Les strotypes des rles sexuels, l'emploi et le statut marital ainsi que les pressions sociales diffrentielles peuvent aussi tre significatifs en rendant les femmes plus vulnrables au dveloppement de la dpression. Les femmes peuvent avoir moins de pouvoir dcisionnel, font face des vnements de vie plus adverses et ont un accs plus limit aux ressources, ce qui peut entraner des sentiments d'impuissance et une faible estime de soi. Une faible estime de soi et des cognitions ngatives par rapport soi peuvent tre leur tour des facteurs prdicteurs proximaux d'une humeur ngative. De plus, les femmes peuvent tre plus enclines une centration sur soi ruminative plutt qu' un processus d'adaptation (coping) actif, ceci tant un facteur de risque significatif pour la dpression. Cette tude a examin les prdicteurs individuels de l'humeur dpressive pour chacun des sexes, incluant le processus d'adaptation, l'estime de soi, les penses ngatives, la conscience de soi (la rumination) ainsi que les facteurs sociaux comme l'approbation des strotypes relis aux rles sexuels et du pouvoir dcisionnel dans la famille. Les rsultats ont indiqu que les facteurs sociaux n'taient pas relis l'humeur dprime chez aucun des sexes; ils taient plutt relis aux styles d'adaptation et l'estime de soi. L'humeur dprime tait associe aux caractristiques individuelles comme les styles d'adaptation vitant, l'anxit sociale pour les femmes et la centration sur soi ruminative pour les hommes. Une analyse de rgression a montr que le processus d'adaptation travers le dni et les penses ngatives a expliqu l'humeur dprime et cette dernire tait particulirement vraie pour les hommes. Ces rsultats soulignent l'importance d'examiner la fois les facteurs individuels et sociaux lorsque nous tentons de comprendre la dpression chez les hommes et les femmes. Tpicamente, las investigaciones encuentran que la depresin es dos veces ms comn entre mujeres en comparacin con los hombres. ste puede ser el resultado de las diferencias en socializacin relativas a diferentes reacciones emocionales, cognitivas y de resolucin de problemas. Los roles estereotpicos de gnero, empleo y el estado civil, junto con distintas presiones sociales tambin pueden hacer las mujeres significativamente ms vulnerables a la depresin. Las mujeres pueden tener menos poder en la toma de decisiones, hacer frente a ms sucesos vitales adversos teniendo acceso limitado a los recursos lo cual puede conducir a los sentimientos de indefensin y baja autoestima. Baja autoestima y los pensamientos negativos acerca de si mismo pueden ser predictores de afecto negativo. Adems, las mujeres pueden ser ms propensas a ruminaciones enfocadas en si mismas, en vez de las estrategias activas de resolucin de problemas y ste es un factor de riesgo significativo para el desarrollo de depresin. Este estudio analiza factores individuales predictores de un estado de nimo depresivo para cada uno de los sexos, incluyendo resolucin de problemas, autoestima, pensamientos negativos, auto-conciencia (ruminacin) tanto como los factores sociales tales como los estereotipos relacionados con roles de gnero y el poder de toma de decisiones en la familia. Los resultados indican que los factores sociales no se relacionaron con el estado afectivo depresivo en ambos sexos pero s se relacionaron con los estilos de resolucin de problemas y autoestima. El estado de nimo depresivo se asociaba con las caractersticas individuales tales como estilo de evitacin en resolucin de problemas, ansiedad social en mujeres y ruminaciones auto-enfocadas en los hombres.

An sp-score gives a very concise summary of a review and provides more information than binary classification. The difficulty of this task lies in the quantification of polarity. In this paper we use support vector regression (SVR) to tackle the problem. Experiments on book reviews with five-point scales show that SVR outperforms a multi-class classification method using support vector machines and the results are close to human performance. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.,,Sentiment polarity score; Support vector machines; Support vector regression (SVR); Binary codes; Classification (of information); Information retrieval systems; Performance; Regression analysis; Vectors; Learning systems,2-s2.0-33646016554

Contrary to the initial tendency to reduce right-wing extremism and define it on the basis of a single characteristic (i.e. anti-foreigner sentiments), it is defined as a broad concept that reflects a multi-layered ideology. We theorized that hostile attitudes towards out-groups are the result of in-group favoritism, and that this may be particularly apt when a sense of socio-economic competition arises. Findings obtained through the analyses of three models via structural equation modeling show that the socio-economic variables have significant direct negative effects on the socio-psychological mediating variables, and also have negative indirect effects on right-wing extremism, via their influence on the mediating socio-psychological variables. While persons with strong social identification tendencies are likely to espouse right-wing extremist ideologies whether they are high or low on the socio-economic status, persons who score low on socio-economic indicators are not likely to support right-wing extremist ideologies unless they also have strong mechanisms of social identification. © 2004 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.",,authoritarianism; political ideology; public attitude; socioeconomic status; Asia; Eurasia; Israel; Middle East,2-s2.0-4344682811

Empirical work on this topic typically focuses on consumer confidence, the perceptions of buyers of consumption goods. This paper examines whether perceptions of sellers of consumption goods, measured by retail trade surveys, may also improve short-term monitoring of consumption. We find that both consumer confidence and retailer confidence embody valuable information, when analysed in isolation. For France, Italy and Spain we conclude that adding retail confidence does not improve the indicator model once consumer confidence has been included. For the UK the reverse case is obtained. For the remaining four countries we show that combining consumer sentiment and retail trade confidence into a composite indicator leads to optimal results. Our results suggest that incorporating information from retail trade surveys may offer significant benefits for the analysis of short-term prospects of consumption. © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Composite indicators; Consumer confidence; Consumption; Retail trade confidence,Commerce; Economic and social effects; Human engineering; Information analysis; Mathematical models; Sensory perception; Surveys; Composite indicators; Consumer confidence; Consumption; Retail trade confidence; Consumer products,2-s2.0-1842508094

De Rosa examines the multifaceted nature of domestic abolitionism, a discourse that nineteenth-century women created to voice their political sentiments when cultural imperatives demanded their silence. For nineteenth-century women struggling to find an abolitionist voice while maintaining the codes of gender and respectability, writing children's literature was an acceptable strategy to counteract the opposition. By seizing the opportunity to write abolitionist juvenile literature, De Rosa argues, domestic abolitionists were able to enter the public arena while simultaneously maintaining their identities as exemplary mother-educators and preserving their claims to ""femininity."" Using close textual analyses of archival materials, De Rosa examines the convergence of discourses about slavery, gender, and children in juvenile literature from 1830 to 1865, filling an important gap in our understanding of women's literary productions about race and gender, as well as our understanding of nineteenth-century American literature more generally. © 2003 State University of New York.

Methods: Construct validity was evaluated by factor analysis and by comparison of the results with those of the original SCQ study. Reliability was evaluated by Cronbach's alpha and by item-total correlations. Feasibility was assessed by a standardized index of missing values. Results: The three domains found in the original SCQ were identified by factor analysis: consequences of involvement in care for the personal life of the caregiver, satisfaction with one's own performance as a caregiver and satisfaction with the elderly person as a recipient of care. The mean scores were similar to those in the original study, except for the consequences for personal life. Cronbach's alpha for both the SCQ and the SSCQ exceeded the 0.70 criterion. Two of the 27 items did not meet the item-total correlation criterion; the SSCQ items all met the criterion. The standardised index of missing values was deemed acceptable.

The author emphatically denies that the eruption of protracted civil war in these countries is due to preexisting ethnic animosities between peoples. Instead, he takes a dynamic view of the concept of the nation and explains the formation (and transformation) of nationalist constituencies and sentiments in Sri Lanka and Yugoslavia in terms of a process of dialectical interaction between the modern state and diverse civil societies. The state crises in Sri Lanka and Yugoslavia, he argues, can be best understood through a critical focus on how centralist, unitarist strategic elites at the helm of state apparatuses in these countries have, over the past several decades, engendered growing political opposition. © 1995, SAGE Periodicals Press.

Four dimensions of paramilitarism are examined: mobilization, constitutionalism, order-maintenance, and reactive public behavior. The results offer more support for the critical than for the benevolent perspective. The data reveal elite sponsorship and deviant social composition; perceptions of unconstitutionality and illegal behaviors; disruptive and abusive activities; and far more anti- than pro-paramilitary sentiment and political behavior.

For the first study, 280 subjects rated 53 items that constituted the fulfillment sentiment instrument. The data were analysed by means of factor-analyses. Results of the analysis revealed that the fulfillment sentiment consisted of 4 factors, thus confirming the model proposed by Nishihira. Four factors were named (l) fulfillment sentimemt vs. boredom-emptiness, (2) jiritsu-jishin (independence and self-reliance) vs. amae and lack of self-reliance, (3) solidarity vs. isolation, (4) trust and time-perspective vs. mistrust and time-diffusion. An examination on the pattern of correlations among four scales indicated the followings: the scale for fulfillment vs. boredom-emptiness showed significant positive correlation with the scale for jiritsu-jishin vs. amae and lack of self-reliance, the scale for solidarity vs. isolation, and the scale for trust and time-perspective vs. mistrust and time-diffusion. These results provided positive evidence to support the Nishihira's model. However, it was found that that the Nishihira's model might require a certain modification on the basis of results. The second study was designed to examine stability of each factor of the fulfillment sentiment scale by using the identical factor score method proposed by Bentler(1973). It was found that stability of the fulfillment vs. boredom-emptiness scores was lower than that of jiritsu-jishin vs. amae and lack of self -reliance, solidarity vs. isolation, and trust and time-perspective vs. mistrust and time-diffusion.

He, in fact, relegates it to secondary status as a form of social organization, and his position is used to legitimate a sociology that looks to explanation by means of beliefs, sentiments, and values. But there are available data which cast doubt on some portions of Durkheim's argument concerning the secondary nature of the division of labor, and a close examination of Durkheim's analysis of the division of labor raises serious doubts about the logical adequacy of his position.

This social developmental hypothesis is tested by examining the organization of interpersonal sentiment preferences in 118 groups of children ranging in age from 3 to 11 years. Multiple regression techniques are used to examine the effect of age on structure. The results indicate that there is a significant relationship between age and the extent of transitive organization in the structure of the children's interpersonal preferences.

We aim to extract basic emotions from short sentences with emotional content (e.g. news titles, tweets, captions), performing a web-based quantitative evaluation of semantic proximity between each word of the analyzed sentence and each emotion of a psychological model (e.g. Plutchik, Ekman, Lovheim). The phases of the extraction include: text preprocessing (tokenization, stop words, filtering), search engine automated query, HTML parsing of results (i.e. scraping), estimation of semantic proximity, ranking of emotions according to proximity measures. The main idea is that, since it is possible to generalize semantic similarity under the assumption that similar concepts co-occur in documents indexed in search engines, therefore also emotions can be generalized in the same way, through tags or terms that express them in a particular language, ranking emotions. Training results are compared to human evaluation, then additional comparative tests on results are performed, both for the global ranking correlation (e.g. Kendall, Spearman, Pearson) both for the evaluation of the emotion linked to each single word. Different from sentiment analysis, our approach works at a deeper level of abstraction, aiming to recognize specific emotions and not only the positive/negative sentiment, in order to predict emotions as semantic data. © 2016 ACM.",Affective data; Emotion extraction; Emotion recognition; Information retrieval; Semantic similarity measures,Cloud computing; Extraction; Information retrieval; Natural language processing systems; Search engines; Semantics; Speech recognition; Syntactics; Websites; Affective data; Emotion extractions; Emotion recognition; Level of abstraction; Psychological model; Quantitative evaluation; Semantic similarity; Semantic similarity measures; Semantic Web,2-s2.0-85009113178

However, existing resources of this type exhibit some limitations when applied to social media messages such as tweets (posts in Twitter), because they are unable to capture the diversity of informal expressions commonly found in this type of media. In this article, we present a method that combines information from automatically annotated tweets and existing hand-made opinion lexicons to expand an opinion lexicon in a supervised fashion. The expanded lexicon contains part-of-speech (POS) disambiguated entries with a probability distribution for positive, negative, and neutral polarity classes, similarly to SentiWordNet. To obtain this distribution using machine learning, we propose word-level attributes based on (a) the morphological information conveyed by POS tags and (b) associations between words and the sentiment expressed in the tweets that contain them. We consider tweets with both hard and soft sentiment labels. The sentiment associations are modeled in two different ways: using point-wise-mutual-information semantic orientation (PMI-SO), and using stochastic gradient descent semantic orientation (SGD-SO), which learns a linear relationship between words and sentiment. The training dataset is labeled by a seed lexicon formed by combining multiple hand-annotated lexicons. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms the three-dimensional word-level polarity classification performance obtained by using PMI-SO alone. This is significant because PMI-SO is a state-of-the-art measure for establishing world-level sentiment. Additionally, we show that lexicons created with our method achieve significant improvements over SentiWordNet for classifying tweets into polarity classes, and also outperform SentiStrength in the majority of the experiments. © 2016",Lexicon expansion; Sentiment analysis; Twitter,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Learning systems; Probability distributions; Semantics; Social networking (online); Stochastic systems; Lexicon expansions; Linear relationships; Morphological information; Polarity classification; Semantic orientation; Sentiment analysis; Stochastic gradient descent; Twitter; Classification (of information),2-s2.0-84969522989

The approach is based on statistical measures applied over a vast set of labeled messages from StockTwits, which is a specialized stock market microblog. We compare three adaptations of statistical measures, such as Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI), two new complementary statistics and the use of sentiment scores for affirmative and negated contexts. Using StockTwits, we show that the new lexicons are competitive for measuring investor sentiment when compared with six popular lexicons. We also applied a lexicon to easily produce Twitter investor sentiment indicators and analyzed their correlation with survey sentiment indexes. The new microblogging indicators have a moderate correlation with popular Investors Intelligence (II) and American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) indicators.

Concerns may be warranted, as many priority metal pollutants may be present in biosolids. This study represents the first time that extensive use was made of a handheld X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyser to characterise metals in sludges, having undergone treatment by thermal drying, lime stabilisation, or anaerobic digestion, in 16 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Ireland. The concentrations of metals, expressed as mg kg-1 dry solids (DS), which are currently regulated in the European Union, ranged from 11 (cadmium, anaerobically digested (AD) biosolids) to 1273 mg kg-1 (zinc, AD biosolids), and with the exception of lead in one WWTP (which had a concentration of 3696 mg kg-1), all metals were within EU regulatory limits. Two potentially hazardous metals, antimony (Sb) and tin (Sn), for which no legislation currently exists, were much higher than their baseline concentrations in soils (17-20mgSbkg-1 and 23-55mgSnkg-1), meaning that potentially large amounts of these elements may be applied to the soil without regulation. This study recommends that the regulations governing the values for metal concentrations in sludges for reuse in agriculture are extended to include Sb and Sn. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Biosolids; Land application; Metals; Treated sludge,"Anaerobic digestion; Biological materials; Biosolids; Laws and legislation; Lime; Sewage; Sewage sludge; Tin; Wastewater treatment; X ray spectrometers; Anaerobically digested sewage sludge; Base-line concentrations; Land applications; Lime stabilisation; Metal concentrations; Treated sludge; Wastewater treatment plants; X ray fluorescence; Metals; antimony; arsenic; cadmium; calcium oxide; copper; lead; mercury; metal; molybdenum; nickel; selenium; tin; zinc; calcium derivative; metal; oxide; sewage; soil; soil pollutant; waste water; biosolid; concentration (composition); lime; regulatory framework; sewage treatment; sludge; soil pollution; trace metal; agricultural procedures; anaerobic digestion; Article; biosolid; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental management; European Union; Ireland; priority journal; sludge drying; sludge treatment; soil pollution; waste water recycling; waste water treatment plant; X ray fluorescence; agriculture; anaerobic growth; chemistry; cost benefit analysis; procedures; quality control; sewage; soil; soil pollutant; spectrofluorometry; waste water; water management; X ray; Agriculture; Anaerobiosis; Cadmium; Calcium Compounds; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Ireland; Metals; Oxides; Quality Control; Selenium; Sewage; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Tin; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Purification; X-Rays; Zinc",2-s2.0-84952990765

Seminal methods extract manual discrete features from automatic syntactic parse trees in order to capture semantic information of the enclosing sentence with respect to a target entity mention. Recently, it has been shown that competitive accuracies can be achieved without using syntactic parsers, which can be highly inaccurate on noisy text such as tweets. This is achieved by applying distributed word representations and rich neural pooling functions over a simple and intuitive segmentation of tweets according to target entity mentions. In this paper, we extend this idea by proposing a sentencelevel neural model to address the limitation of pooling functions, which do not explicitly model tweet-level semantics. First, a bi-directional gated neural network is used to connect the words in a tweet so that pooling functions can be applied over the hidden layer instead of words for better representing the target and its contexts. Second, a three-way gated neural network structure is used to model the interaction between the target mention and its surrounding contexts. Experiments show that our proposed model gives significantly higher accuracies compared to the current best method for targeted sentiment analysis. © 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

They are therefore regarded as one of the most important signals for microblog sentiment analysis. Most existing studies use several emoticons that convey clear emotional meanings as noisy sentiment labels or similar sentiment indicators. However, in practical microblog environments, tens or even hundreds of emoticons are frequently adopted and all emoticons have their own unique emotional meanings. Besides, a considerable number of emoticons do not have clear emotional meanings. An improved sentiment analysis model should not overlook these phenomena. Instead of manually assigning sentiment labels to several emoticons that convey relatively clear meanings, we propose the emoticon space model (ESM) that leverages more emoticons to construct word representations from a massive amount of unlabeled data. By projecting words and microblog posts into an emoticon space, the proposed model helps identify subjectivity, polarity, and emotion in microblog environments.

To estimate the degree to which the inclusion of idioms as features may potentially improve the results of traditional sentiment analysis, we compared our results to two such methods. First, to support idioms as features we collected a set of 580 idioms that are relevant to sentiment analysis, i.e. the ones that can be mapped to an emotion. These mappings were then obtained using a web-based crowdsourcing approach. The quality of the crowdsourced information is demonstrated with high agreement among five independent annotators calculated using Krippendorff's alpha coefficient (α = 0.662). Second, to evaluate the results of sentiment analysis, we assembled a corpus of sentences in which idioms are used in context. Each sentence was annotated with an emotion, which formed the basis for the gold standard used for the comparison against two baseline methods. The performance was evaluated in terms of three measures - precision, recall and F-measure. Overall, our approach achieved 64% and 61% for these three measures in two experiments improving the baseline results by 20 and 15 percent points respectively. F-measure was significantly improved over all three sentiment polarity classes: Positive, Negative and Other. Most notable improvement was recorded in classification of positive sentiments, where recall was improved by 45 percent points in both experiments without compromising the precision. The statistical significance of these improvements was confirmed by McNemar's test. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Each record stored in the index is annotated with the polarity and domain of the sentence it represents; this way, it is possible to have a more fine-grained representation of the learnt sentiment information. When the polarity of a new sentence has to be computed, the new sentence is converted to a query and a two-steps computation is performed: firstly, a domain is assigned to the sentence by comparing the sentence content with domain contextual information learnt during the training phase, and, secondly, once the domain is assigned to the sentence, the polarity is computed and assigned to the new sentence.

The underpricing of stocks in IPOs, or essentially leaving money on the table, is considered as an important, challenging and worthy research topic in literature. Within the proposed framework, the IPO performance in the short run and the factors that affect this short run performance were analyzed. Popular machine learning methods - several decision tree models and support vector machines - were developed to investigate the major factors affecting the short-term performance of initial IPOs. A k-fold cross validation methodology was used to assess and contrast the performance of the predictive models. An information fusion-based sensitivity analysis was performed to combine the values of individual variable importance results into a common representation. The results showed that there was underpricing in the initial public offerings of Turkish companies, although it was not as high as the underpricing determined in developed markets. The market sentiment, the annual sales amounts, the total assets turnover rates, IPO stocks sales methods, the underwriting methods, the offer prices, debt ratio, and number of shares sold were among the most influential factors affecting the short term performance of initial public offerings of Turkish companies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, less effort has been devoted to the analysis of the semantic content of messages exchanged during the protest. Using the data obtained from a microblogging service during the brewing and active phases of the 15M movement in Spain, we perform the first large scale test of theories on collective emotions and social interaction in collective actions. Our findings show that activity and information cascades in the movement are larger in the presence of negative collective emotions and when users express themselves in terms related to social content. At the level of individual participants, our results show that their social integration in the movement, as measured through social network metrics, increases with their level of engagement and of expression of negativity.

The ability to analyze conversations about e-cigarettes in real-time can provide important insight into trends in the public's knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs surrounding e-cigarettes, and subsequently guide public health interventions. Objective: Our aim was to establish a supervised machine learning algorithm to build predictive classification models that assess Twitter data for a range of factors related to e-cigarettes. Methods: Manual content analysis was conducted for 17,098 tweets. These tweets were coded for five categories: e-cigarette relevance, sentiment, user description, genre, and theme. Machine learning classification models were then built for each of these five categories, and word groupings (n-grams) were used to define the feature space for each classifier. Results: Predictive performance scores for classification models indicated that the models correctly labeled the tweets with the appropriate variables between 68.40% and 99.34% of the time, and the percentage of maximum possible improvement over a random baseline that was achieved by the classification models ranged from 41.59% to 80.62%. Classifiers with the highest performance scores that also achieved the highest percentage of the maximum possible improvement over a random baseline were Policy/Government (performance: 0.94; % improvement: 80.62%), Relevance (performance: 0.94; % improvement: 75.26%), Ad or Promotion (performance: 0.89; % improvement: 72.69%), and Marketing (performance: 0.91; % improvement: 72.56%). The most appropriate word-grouping unit (n-gram) was 1 for the majority of classifiers. Performance continued to marginally increase with the size of the training dataset of manually annotated data, but eventually leveled off. Even at low dataset sizes of 4000 observations, performance characteristics were fairly sound. Conclusions: Social media outlets like Twitter can uncover real-time snapshots of personal sentiment, knowledge, attitudes, and behavior that are not as accessible, at this scale, through any other offline platform. Using the vast data available through social media presents an opportunity for social science and public health methodologies to utilize computational methodologies to enhance and extend research and practice. This study was successful in automating a complex five-category manual content analysis of e-cigarette-related content on Twitter using machine learning techniques.

In particular, microblogging platforms such as Twitter have become important tools to assess public opinion on different issues. Recently, some approaches for assessing Twitter messages have been developed, identifying sentiments associated with relevant keywords or hashtags. However, such approaches have an important limitation, as they do not take into account contradictory and potentially inconsistent information which might emerge from relevant messages. We contend that the information made available in Twitter can be useful to extract a particular version of arguments (called opinions in our formalization) which emerge bottom-up from the social interaction associated with such messages. In this paper we present a novel framework which allows to mine opinions from Twitter based on incrementally generated queries. As a result, we will be able to obtain an opinion tree, rooted in the first original query. Distinguished, conflicting elements in an opinion tree lead to so-called conflict trees, which resemble dialectical trees as those used traditionally in defeasible argumentation.11 This paper extends preliminary work [11] presented at the First International Conference on Agreement Technologies (AT 2012), held in Dubrovnik, Croatia, in October 2012. © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.",Argumentation; opinion mining; social media,Data mining; Forestry; Social aspects; Agreement technologies; Argumentation; Inconsistent information; Micro-blogging platforms; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Social interactions; Social media; Social networking (online); Algorithms; Data Processing; Information Retrieval,2-s2.0-84938096354

Objective: The aim was to examine the type, context, and dissemination of pain-related tweets. Methods: We used content analysis of pain-related tweets from 50 cities to unobtrusively explore the meanings and patterns of communications about pain. Content was examined by location and time of day, as well as within the context of online social networks. Results: The most common terms published in conjunction with the term ""pain"" included feel (n=1504), don't (n=702), and love (n=649). The proportion of tweets with positive sentiment ranged from 13% in Manila to 56% in Los Angeles, CA, with a median of 29% across cities. Temporally, the proportion of tweets with positive sentiment ranged from 24% at 1600 to 38% at 2400, with a median of 32%. The Twitter-based social networks pertaining to pain exhibited greater sparsity and lower connectedness than did those social networks pertaining to common terms such as apple, Manchester United, and Obama. The number of word clusters in proportion to node count was greater for emotion terms such as tired (0.45), happy (0.43), and sad (0.4) when compared with objective terms such as apple (0.26), Manchester United (0.14), and Obama (0.25).

Existing navigation systems are designed to suggest routes based on the shortest distance or the fastest time to a target. In this paper, we propose a new type of route navigation based on regional context-primarily sentiments. Our system, called SocRoutes, aims to find a safer, friendlier, and more enjoyable route based on sentiments inferred from real-time, geotagged messages from Twitter. SocRoutes tailors routes by avoiding places with extremely negative sentiments, thereby potentially finding a safer and more enjoyable route with marginal increase in total distance compared to the shortest path. The system supports three types of traveling modes: walking, bicycling, and driving. We validated the idea based on crime history data from the City of Chicago Portal in December 2012, and sentiments extracted from geotagged tweets during the same time. We discovered that there was a significant correlation between regional Twitter posting sentiments and crime rate, in particular for high-crime and highly negative sentiment areas. We also demonstrated that SocRoutes, by solely utilizing social media sentiments, can find routes that bypass crime hotspots. © Copyright 2014 by the International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee.",Navigation system; Safety; Sentiment analysis; Web applications,Accident prevention; Crime; Navigation systems; Social networking (online); Telecommunication services; World Wide Web; GPS technologies; Negative sentiments; Personal navigation system; Route navigation; Sentiment analysis; System supports; Total distances; WEB application; Location based services,2-s2.0-84990944684

Considering good performances of unsupervised neural network language models in a wide range of natural language processing tasks, a semi-supervised deep learning model has been proposed for sentiment analysis. The model introduces supervised sentiment labels into traditional neural network language models.

The analysis of such data (aka. sentiment analysis) is quickly becoming a key feature in recommender systems and search engines. A prominent approach to sentiment analysis is based on the application of classification techniques, that is, content is classified according to the attitude of the writer. A major challenge, however, is that Twitter follows the data stream model, and thus classifiers must operate with limited resources, including labeled data and time for building classification models. Also challenging is the fact that sentiment distribution may change as the stream evolves. In this paper we address these challenges by proposing algorithms that select relevant training instances at each time step, so that training sets are kept small while providing to the classifier the capabilities to suit itself to, and to recover itself from, different types of sentiment drifts. Simultaneously providing capabilities to the classifier, however, is a conflicting-objective problem, and our proposed algorithms employ basic notions of Economics in order to balance both capabilities. We performed the analysis of events that reverberated on Twitter, and the comparison against the state-of-the-art reveals improvements both in terms of error reduction (up to 14%) and reduction of training resources (by orders of magnitude).

We propose to overcome this limitation by expanding a general lexicon with domain-dependent opinion words as well as abbreviations and informal opinion expressions. The expanded terms are automatically selected based on their mutual information with emoticons. As there is an abundant amount of emoticon-bearing tweets on Twitter, our approach provides a way to do domain-dependent sentiment analysis without the cost of data annotation.

Also, one cannot set his mind based on reading some of the review since it gives him a biased view about that product. So we need to automate this process. As we know, there are lots of opinion words present in the sentences of a review which will tell about the polarity of that product. Out of all the opinion words, some words behave in the same manner means they have the same polarity in all contexts, but some words are context dependent means they have different polarity in different context. In this paper, we proposed an Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis and Summarization (ASAS) System, which handles the context dependent opinion words that has been the cause of major difficulties. For finding the opinion polarity, first, we used an online dictionary for classifying the context independent opinion word. Second, we used natural linguistic rules for assigning the polarity to maximum possible context dependent words. These steps create the training data set. Third, for classification of the remaining opinion words, we used opinion words and feature together rather than opinion words alone, because the same opinion word can have different polarity in the same domain. Then we used our Interaction Information method to classify the feature-opinion pairs. Fourth, as negation plays a very crucial role, we found negation words and flipped the polarity of the corresponding opinion word. Finally, after classifying each opinion word, the system generated a short summary for that particular product based on each feature © 2014 The Authors.",Context dependent opinions; Feature based clustering; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Text summarization,Data mining; Knowledge based systems; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Context dependent; Feature-based; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Text summarization; Classification (of information),2-s2.0-84924100632

The goal is sentiment analysis on a corpus containing short textual descriptions of dreams. Dreams are categorized in a four-level scale of positive and negative sentiments. We chose a four scale annotation to reflect the sentiment strength and simplicity at the same time. The approach is based on a novel representation, taking into account the leading themes of the dream and the sequential unfolding of associated sentiments during the dream. The dream representation is based on three combined parts, two of which are automatically produced from the description of the dream. The first part consists of co-occurrence vector representation of dreams in order to detect sentiment levels in the dream texts. Those vectors unlike the standard Bag-of-words model capture non-local relationships between meanings of word in a corpus. The second part introduces the dynamic representation that captures the sentimental changes throughout the progress of the dream. The third part is the self-reported assessment of the dream by the dreamer according to eight given attributes (self-assessment is different in many respects from the dream's sentiment classification). The three representations are subject to aggressive feature selection. Using an ensemble of classifiers on the combined 3-partite representation, the agreement between machine rating and the human judge scores on the four scales was 64 % which is in the range of human experts' consensus in that domain. The accuracy of the system was 14 % more than previous results on the same task. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.",Dream analysis; Emotion analysis; Natural Language Processing (NLP); Sentiment analysis; Text classification; Text mining; Text representation,Classification (of information); Data mining; Information retrieval; Linguistics; Text processing; Dream analysis; Emotion analysis; NAtural language processing; Sentiment analysis; Text classification; Text mining; Text representation; Natural language processing systems,2-s2.0-84901604448

Specifically, we wish to characterize the relationship between the language used on Twitter and the results of the 2011 NBA Playoff games. We hypothesize that the language used by Twitter users will be useful in classifying the users' locations combined with the current status of which team is in the lead during the game. This is based on the common assumption that ""fans"" of a team have more positive sentiment and will accordingly use different language when their team is doing well. We investigate this hypothesis by labeling each tweet according the the location of the user along with the team that is in the lead at the time of the tweet. The hypothesized difference in language (as measured by tf-idf) should then have predictive power over the tweet labels. We find that indeed it does and we experiment further by adding semantic orientation (SO) information as part of the feature set. The SO does not offer much improvement over tf-idf alone. We discuss the relative strengths of the two types of features for our data.

In this paper, we explore a new concept for aspect-level review analysis, latent sentiment explanations, which are defined as a set of informative aspect-specific sentences whose polarities are consistent with that of the review. In other words, sentiment explanations best represent a review in terms of both aspect and polarity. We formulate the problem as a structure learning problem, and sentiment explanations are modeled with latent variables. Training samples are automatically identified through a set of pre-defined aspect signature terms (i.e., without manual annotation on samples), which we term the way weakly supervised. Our major contributions lie in two folds: first, we formalize the use of aspect signature terms as weak supervision in a structural learning framework, which remarkably promotes aspect-level analysis; second, the performance of aspect analysis and document-level sentiment classification are mutually enhanced through joint modeling. The proposed method is evaluated on restaurant and hotel reviews respectively, and experimental results demonstrate promising performance in both document-level and aspect-level sentiment analysis.

In general, sentiment classification means the analysis to determine the expression of a speaker whether he or she holds positive or negative opinion to a specific subject. With the rapid growth of e-commerce, sentiment analysis can greatly influence everyone in their real life. For example, product reviews on the Web have become an important source of information for customers' decision making when they want to buy any product. As the reviews are often too many for customers to go through, how to automatically classify and detect the sentiment from them has become an important research problem. In this chapter, the authors present a Sentiment Analyzer that recognizes the Bangla sentiment or opinion about a subject from Bangla text. They construct some phrase patterns and calculate their sentiment orientation. They add tags to words in the Bangla text to construct the phrase pattern for positive and negative sentiment.

Behavioural patterns are injected into an asset pricing framework through the so-called 'Break Point Date', which allows us to examine their direct impact. In particular, we analyse the dynamics of the model around the behavioural break. Price behaviour of 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average constituents covering five particularly turbulent US stock market periods reveals interesting patterns in this aspect. To replicate it, we apply numerical analysis using the Heterogeneous Agent Model extended with the selected findings from behavioural finance: herding, overconfidence, and market sentiment. We show that these behavioural breaks can be well modelled via the Heterogeneous Agent Model framework and they extend the original model considerably. Various modifications lead to significantly different results and model with behavioural breaks is also able to partially replicate price behaviour found in the data during turbulent stock market periods. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The primary objective of this study was to determine if analysis of a large-sample of anonymous internet conversations (ICs) could be utilized to identify unmet public needs regarding AS. English-language ICs regarding prostate cancer (PC) treatment with AS from 2002-12 were identified using a novel internet search methodology. Web spiders were developed to mine, aggregate, and analyze content from the world-wide-web for ICs centered on AS. Collection of ICs was not restricted to any specific geographic region of origin. NLP was used to evaluate content and perform a sentiment analysis. Conversations were scored as positive, negative, or neutral. A sentiment index (SI) was subsequently calculated according to the following formula to compare temporal trends in public sentiment towards AS: [(# Positive IC/#Total IC)-(#Negative IC/#Total IC) x 100]. A total of 464 ICs were identified. Sentiment increased from -13 to +2 over the study period. The increase sentiment has been driven by increased patient emphasis on quality-of-life factors and endorsement of AS by national medical organizations. Unmet needs identified in these ICs include: a gap between quantitative data regarding long-term outcomes with AS vs. conventional treatments, desire for treatment information from an unbiased specialist, and absence of public role models managed with AS. This study demonstrates the potential utility of online patient communications to provide insight into patient preferences and decision-making. Based on our findings, we recommend that multidisciplinary clinics consider including an unbiased specialist to present treatment options and that future decision tools for AS include quantitative data regarding outcomes after AS.",,article; epidemiological monitoring; human; information seeking; Internet; male; patient attitude; patient preference; prostate tumor; psychological aspect; quality of life; watchful waiting; Epidemiological Monitoring; Humans; Information Seeking Behavior; Internet; Male; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Patient Preference; Prostatic Neoplasms; Quality of Life; Watchful Waiting,2-s2.0-84898037603

It prevents influenza infection among patients and reduces staff illness and absenteeism. Despite these benefits, HCW influenza immunization uptake is low. Therefore, strategies to achieve high immunization coverage in HCWs, barriers to uptake, and perceptions of mandatory influenza immunization policies were discussed in key informant interviews with influenza immunization program planners. Methods We conducted telephone interviews with 23 influenza immunization program planners from 21 organizations (7 acute care hospitals, 6 continuing care facilities, and 8 public health organizations) across Canada. We used content analysis to identify themes from the interviews. Results Participants used a variety of promotional and educational activities, and many vaccine delivery approaches, to support HCW immunization programs. Barriers to achieving high coverage in HCWs included misconceptions about the safety and effectiveness of the influenza vaccine, negative personal experiences associated with the vaccine, and antivaccine sentiments. Participants mentioned mandatory influenza immunizations as a solution to low coverage. However, they identified challenges with this approach such as obtaining support from stakeholders, enforcement, and limiting personal autonomy. Conclusion Participants believed immunization coverage in health care organizations will continue to be suboptimal using existing program strategies. Although participants discussed mandatory immunization as a way to improve uptake, potential obstacles will need to be addressed for this to be implemented successfully.

Clinical Practice Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis provide guidance for the management of individuals 50 years and older at risk for fractures, however, they cannot benefit LTC residents if physicians perceive barriers to their application. Our objectives are to explore current practices to fracture risk assessment by LTC physicians and describe barriers to applying the recently published Osteoporosis Canada practice guidelines for fracture assessment and prevention in LTC. Methods. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with the Ontario Long-Term Care Physicians Association using an online questionnaire. The survey included questions that addressed members' attitudes, knowledge, and behaviour with respect to fracture risk assessment in LTC. Closed-ended responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and thematic framework analysis for open-ended responses. Results: We contacted 347 LTC physicians; 25% submitted completed surveys (81% men, mean age 60 (Standard Deviation [SD] 11) years, average 32 [SD 11] years in practice). Of the surveyed physicians, 87% considered prevention of fragility fractures to be important, but a minority (34%) reported using validated fracture risk assessment tools, while 33% did not use any. Clinical risk factors recommended by the OC guidelines for assessing fracture risk considered applicable included; glucocorticoid use (99%), fall history (93%), age (92%), and fracture history (91%). Recommended clinical measurements considered applicable included: weight (84%), thyroid-stimulating hormone (78%) and creatinine (73%) measurements, height (61%), and Get-Up-and-Go test (60%). Perceived barriers to assessing fracture risk included difficulty acquiring necessary information, lack of access to tests (bone mineral density, x-rays) or obtaining medical history; resource constraints, and a sentiment that assessing fracture risk is futile in this population because of short life expectancy and polypharmacy. Conclusion: Perceived barriers to fracture risk assessment and osteoporosis management in LTC have not changed recently, contributing in part to the ongoing care gap in osteoporosis management. Our findings highlight the importance to adapt guidelines to be applicable to the LTC environment, and to develop partnerships with stakeholders to facilitate their use in clinical practice. © 2013 Wall et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Fracture risk assessment; Fractures; Long-term care; Osteoporosis; Survey,"aged; article; Canada; cross-sectional study; female; fracture; human; long term care; male; methodology; middle aged; osteoporosis; physician; questionnaire; risk assessment; statistics; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Fractures, Bone; Humans; Long-Term Care; Male; Middle Aged; Ontario; Osteoporosis; Physicians; Questionnaires; Risk Assessment",2-s2.0-84885547547

Instead, they face an oppressive situation in which they struggle to make ends meet. This paper presents focused findings from an ethnographic study with a migrant Latino community in North Carolina. Analyses of participant observations and semi-structured interviews revealed that migrants to Smalltown experience fear, discrimination, and exploitation due to government policies and anti-immigrant sentiment. Section 287(g) and the REAL ID Act cause migrants to face the possibility of detention and deportation when driving. Mistrust in government institutions and law enforcement precipitate a climate of fear that prevents migrants from accessing services or seeking help. The persistent threat of deportation causes migrants to withdraw from meaningful occupations and to alter their engagement in required occupations. Feelings of hopelessness discourage self-advocacy and encourage exploitation by employers. Migrants lay low and stay out of sight and thereby experience occupational deprivation and imbalance. The paper suggests that occupational scientists should engage political arenas to highlight the unanticipated effects of government policies on occupational participation.

Importantly, recognition of this diversity requires an acknowledgement of the fact that, just as in the broader community, discrimination occurs within gay communities. The present study sought to examine the degree to which racism occurs within gay men's online communities (in the form of anti-Asian sentiment expressed in the profiles of a small number of the 60,082 White Australian gay men living in five major Australian states whose profiles were listed on the website gaydar.com.au during October 2010), the forms that such racism takes, and whether any White gay men resisted such racism. The findings report on a thematic and subsequent rhetorical analysis of the profiles of the sub-sample of 403 White gay men who expressed anti-Asian sentiment. Such sentiment, it was found, was expressed in four distinct ways: 1) the construction of racism as 'personal preference,' 2) the construction of Asian gay men as not 'real men,' 3) the construction of Asian gay men as a 'type,' and 4) the assumption that saying 'sorry' renders anti-Asian sentiment somehow acceptable. Whilst the numbers of White gay men expressing anti-Asian sentiment were relatively small, it is suggested that the potential impact of anti-Asian sentiment upon Asian gay men who view such profiles may be considerable, and thus that this phenomenon requires ongoing examination. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Anti-Asian sentiment; Asian gay men; Australia; Discrimination; Gaydar; Racial marginalization; Rhetorical analysis; White gay men,,2-s2.0-84877764008

Where less significant development can be observed is in the area of sponsorship evaluation. This paper outlines a specific company case study focusing on a relatively new, but now well-established brand, which made a significant strategic choice in utilizing sponsorship for brand building, market penetration, and the acquisition and retention of consumers in an increasingly commodified service category in contrast to the strategic mix chosen by its main competitors. The paper provides a detailed focus on the management and evaluation of their sponsorship activity in one particular market. Following a brief introduction to the O2 brand and its international development, it will examine the brand's position in the Irish marketplace and the strategically chosen role for sponsorship in its armory of marketing options. It details the key strategic pillars, which underpin the approach to sponsorship as a set of beliefs that hold sponsorship policy and activation together. The challenge, in a mature market dominated by competition for market share, was to drive short-term sales while building long-term brand equity. The industry was experiencing a paradigm shift from ""mobile operators"" to ""social networks"" and the paper explains how the choice and activation of sponsorships sought to develop participative interaction with customers to promote emotionally driven loyalty. To make the brand the basis for differentiation the company chose a marketing mix weighted toward sponsorship and placed ""participation"" at the core of activation. The strategic choices involved regarding the balance of resources between paid-for media and sponsorship and in the latter case, between assets and activation, are explored. Two case studies relating to sport and entertainment sponsorship are detailed with particular reference to innovative and creative activation through social networks. The paper will outline the use of quantitative tracking measures as well as more involved measures in evaluating sponsorship performance. More specifically it will focus on the measurement of sponsorship performance and in particular on the various points at which measurement is brought to bear and the range of metrics-including softer measures such as sentiment analysis and social media conversations-utilized in this evaluation process. It will thus arrive at a comprehensive approach to measuring sponsorship effectiveness and demonstrate how results are translatable to monetary values. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,2-s2.0-84876116955

The two challenges are critical in an industrial context such as marketing. The paper addresses jointly these two issues by analyzing the influence of speech transcription errors on the detection of opinions and business concepts. We present both modules: the speech transcription system, which consists in a successful adaptation of a conversational speech transcription system to call-centre data and the information extraction module, which is based on a semantic modeling of business concepts, opinions and sentiments with complex linguistic rules. Three models of opinions are implemented based on the discourse theory, the appraisal theory and the marketers' expertise, respectively. The influence of speech recognition errors on the information extraction module is evaluated by comparing its outputs on manual versus automatic transcripts. The F-scores obtained are 0.79 for business concepts detection, 0.74 for opinion detection and 0.67 for the extraction of relations between opinions and their target. This result and the in-depth analysis of the errors show the feasibility of opinion detection based on complex rules on call-centre transcripts. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Automatic speech recognition system; Business concept detection; Call-centre data; Disfluency; Opinion detection,,2-s2.0-84890548134

I suggest that Hakim's thesis requires renewed attention not only because of the international reach of her work, but because it reflects a general cultural sentiment concerning women's sexuality and power. I argue that her primary concept-erotic capital-is overstretched, internally inconsistent, and asociological, glossing over the structures of race, class and age that mediate women's access to the resource. Moreover, I show the two ways that Hakim might remedy her theory, but conclude that both are indefensible. In turn, the policy implications Hakim derives from her theory of erotic capital, along with the more general cultural notion that equates sexual desirability with power, are put in high relief. I conclude by noting the existence of a productive stream of sociological theory-the sexual fields framework (Green, 2008)-that develops a concept of erotic/sexual capital which predates Hakim's work and offers a more sociologically grounded analysis of power and desirability. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",Erotic capital; gender inequality; looksism; sexual capital; sexual fields; sexuality,,2-s2.0-84875078597

The first stage of the proposed method is an automatic separation of unambiguous affective and judgmental adjectives from those that express appreciation or different attitudes depending on context. In our experiments with machine learning algorithms we employed three feature sets based on Pointwise Mutual Information, word-pattern co-occurrence, and minimal path length. The next stage of the proposed method is to estimate the potentials of miscellaneous adjectives to convey affect, judgment, and appreciation. Based on the sentences automatically collected for each adjective, the algorithm analyses the context of phrases that contain sentiment words by considering morphological tags, high-level concepts, and named entities, and then makes decisions about contextual attitude labels. Finally, the appraisal potentials of a word are calculated based on the number of sentences related to each type of attitude.

In this study, to overcome the above problems, we utilize pseudo-labeled data, which is extensively explored for distant supervision learning and training language model in Twitter sentiment analysis, to learn the sentence representation through Deep Belief Network algorithm.

An exploratory online questionnaire was designed to generate qualitative and quantitative data of survey participants' perceptions, beliefs and actions towards water issues, such as overconsumption and scarcity. Data analysis included comparison of the quantitative data regarding the non-statistical association between how an individual perceives water and the individual's beliefs, as well as qualitative analysis of the comments using an iterative pattern coding technique.

The attitude may be the person's judgment (e.g., positive vs. negative) or emotional tone (e.g., objective vs. subjective). In this paper we define a supervised learning solution for sentiment analysis on twitter messages which gives profound accuracy using Naïve Bayes Classification. It classifies the tweets either positive or negative. Our dataset consists of tweets containing move reviews retrieved from twitter using certain keywords on a cloud platform. The experiment and analysis has 3 major steps. In the first step, the algorithm used is Naïve Bayes which performed Boolean classification on bag of words, resulting in 71 % of accuracy. In the second step, Naïve Bayes algorithm is applied on bag of words without stop words which gave 72 % accuracy. In the third step, using the concept of Information gain, high value features are selected using Chi Square, which gave maximum accuracy. The evaluating metrics used in this work are Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F-Measure for both the sentiment classes. The results show that Naïve Bayes algorithm with the application of feature selection using the minimum Chi Square value of 3 gave an Accuracy of 89 %, Positive Precision 83.07 %, Positive Recall 97.2 %, Positive F-Measure 89.9 %, Negative Precision 96.6 %, Negative Recall 81.2 % and Negative F-Measure 88.2 %.

When it comes to preparing energy growth scenarios and handling issues related to the choice and assessment of technologies, environmental studies must be in a particular spotlight. One way to make quantitative and qualitative assessment of the effect of technologies on the environment is through a thorough integrated analysis, which, in addition to economic and technical solutions, also considers other aspects of concern to the public. A changed environment demands for systems of criteria which help consider its changes, the attitudes of the general public, public sentiments toward the effect of technologies, public values and community involvement in the process of important decision-making.

Culturomics increasingly needs to consider geographic contexts and, thus, this research develops a geospatial visual analytical approach that transforms vast amounts of textual data into emotional heatmaps with fine-grained spatial resolution. Fulltext geocoding and sentiment mining extract locations and latent ""tone"" from text-based data, which are combined with spatial analysis methods - kernel density estimation and spatial interpolation - to generate heatmaps that capture the interplay of location, topic, and tone toward narrative impacts. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, the complete English edition of Wikipedia is processed using a supercomputer to extract all locations and tone associated with the year of 2003. An emotional heatmap ofWikipedia's discussion of ""armed conflict"" for that year is created using the spatial analysis methods. Unlike previous research, our approach is designed for exploratory spatial analysis of topics in text archives by incorporating multiple attributes including the prominence of each location mentioned in the text, the density of a topic at each location compared to other topics, and the tone of the topics of interest into a single analysis. The generation of such fine-grained emotional heatmaps is computationally intensive particularly when accounting for the multiple attributes at fine scales. Therefore a CyberGIS platform based on national cyberinfrastructure in the United States is used to enable the computationally intensive visual analytics. ©2012 IEEE.",CyberGIS; Digital HASS; Heatmap; Sentiment mining; Spatial text mining,Analytical approach; Armed conflict; Big datum; Culturomics; Cyber infrastructures; CyberGIS; Digital HASS; Geo coding; Geo-spatial; Geographic contexts; Heatmap; Heatmaps; Human society; Kernel Density Estimation; Multiple attributes; Spatial analysis; Spatial interpolation; Spatial resolution; Text mining; Text-based data; Textual data; Visual analytics; Wikipedia; Population statistics; Supercomputers; Data mining,2-s2.0-84873624875

Unlike topic-based text classification, where a high accuracy can be achieved, the sentiment classification is a hard and complicated task. One of the main challenges for document-level sentiment classification is that not every part of the document is equally informative for inferring the polarity of the whole document. Thus, making a distinction between key sentences and trivial sentences will be helpful to improve the sentiment classification performance. We divide a document into key sentences and detailed sentences. Key sentence is usually brief but discriminative while detailed sentences are diverse and ambiguous. For key sentence extraction, our approach takes three attributes into account: sentiment attribute, position attribute and special words attribute. To make use of the discrepancy and complementarity of key sentences and detailed sentences, we incorporate key sentences and detailed sentences in supervised and semi-supervised learning. In supervised sentiment classification, a classifier combination approach is adopted because the original document is divided into two different and complementary parts; in semi-supervised sentiment classification, a co-training algorithm is proposed to incorporate unlabeled data for sentiment classification.

Accurate credit rating information plays a crucial role in supporting sound financial decision-making processes. Most previous studies on credit rating modeling are based on accounting and market information. Text data are largely ignored despite the potential benefit of conveying timely information regarding a firm's outlook. To leverage the additional information in news full-text for credit rating prediction, we designed and implemented a news full-text analysis system that provides firm-level coverage, topic, and sentiment variables. The novel topic-specific sentiment variables contain a large fraction of missing values because of uneven news coverage. The missing value problem creates a new challenge for credit rating prediction approaches. We address this issue by developing a missingtolerant multinomial probit (MT-MNP) model, which imputes missing values based on the Bayesian theoretical framework. Our experiments using seven and a half years of real-world credit ratings and news full-text data show that (1) the overall news coverage can explain future credit rating changes while the aggregated news sentiment cannot; (2) topic-specific news coverage and sentiment have statistically significant impact on future credit rating changes; (3) topic-specific negative sentiment has a more salient impact on future credit rating changes compared to topic-specific positive sentiment; (4) MT-MNP performs better in predicting future credit rating changes compared to support vector machines (SVM).

Multivariate analyses indicate that support for CCS is predicted by a belief that humankind contributes to climate change, a preference for increased use of renewable energy, and egalitarian and individualistic worldviews, while opposition to CCS is predicted by self-identified political conservatism and by selective attitudes regarding energy and climate change.

As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that each product receives grows rapidly. As a result, the problem of automatically mining reviews to extract useful information has recently attracted many researchers. In the last decade, several works have been presented for identifying product aspects from reviews. Product aspects are components or attributes of the product that have been commented on in the review, e.g. 'zoom' and 'battery life' for a digital camera. In this paper, we propose a novel method for mining user opinions, which aims at extracting not only the opinions of users on product aspects, but also a finer level of information indicating the usage type of the aspect. In other words, we try to find out how the reviewer used the aspect. In this work, we focus on the task of identifying product aspects, corresponding opinions, and related usages as a sequence tagging problem. We employ Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to solve the stated problem and propose techniques for defining and filtering features to enhance the accuracy. The accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated using a real life data set from Epinions.com. Experimental evaluation confirms the improved accuracy of our method in identifying aspects, aspect usages, and related opinions.

These properties are found to be significantly different across the examined cohorts, which suggest discriminative features for a number of useful classification tasks. We build binary classifiers for old versus young bloggers, social versus solo bloggers, and happy versus sad posts with high performance.

Noun is the most important features to represent product features. Generative model such as the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) has been used for detecting keyword clusters in document corpus. As adjectives often dominate review corpus, they are often excluded from the vocabulary in such generative model for opinion sentiment analysis. On the other hand, adjectives provide useful context for noun features as they are often semantically related to the nouns. To take advantage of such semantic relations, dependency tree is constructed to extract pairs of noun and adjective with semantic dependency relation. We propose a semantic dependent word pairs generative model for pairs of noun and adjective for each sentence. Product features and their corresponding adjectives are simultaneously clustered into distinct groups which enable improved accuracy of product features as well as providing clustered adjectives. Experimental results demonstrated the advantage of our models with lower perplexity, average cluster entropies, compared to baseline models based on LDA.

Firstly, we employ a machine learning approach based on Conditional Random Field (CRF) for solving the problem of Task C (identification of event-event relations) of TempEval-2007 within TimeML framework by considering sentiment as a feature of an event. Incorporating sentiment property, our system achieves the performance that is better than all the participated state-of-the-art systems of TempEval 2007. Evaluation results on the Task C test set yield the F-score values of 57.2% under the strict evaluation scheme and 58.6% under the relaxed evaluation scheme. The positive or negative coarse grained sentiments as well as the Ekman's six basic universal emotions (or, fine grained sentiments) are assigned to the events. Thereafter, we analyze the temporal relations between events in order to track the sentiment events.

Whereas Japan's renewed territorial claim over Dokdo Island, its distortion of history textbooks and Koizumi's tribute to the Yasukuni Shrine dealt a critical blow to Seoul-Tokyo relations, China's Northeast Project, which claims Korea's ancient kingdom of Goguryeo as a Chinese peripheral local government, provoked widespread anti-Chinese sentiments in South Korea. Nevertheless, South Korea's nationalist responses were not uniform. Seoul responded to Tokyo in a much tougher manner with profound diplomatic implications, whereas public outcry over China did not escalate into any specific retaliatory actions.

Having not too many typical patterns of the desired document type, the user needs a tool that can collect documents which are similar to the patterns. The suggested procedure is based on computing the similarity degree between patterns and unlabeled documents, which are then ranked according to their similarity to the patterns.

The keyword-based approaches for identifying such themes fail to give satisfactory level of accuracy. Here, we address the above problems using statistical text-mining of blog entries. The crux of the analysis lies in mining quantitative information from textual entries. Once the relevant blog entries for the company/its competitors are filtered out, the theme identification is performed using a highly accurate novel technique termed as 'Best Separators Algorithm'.

This is especially crucial when a project is in dispute and hence the achievement of satisfactory project dispute resolution is critical to project success. This proposition has been empirically demonstrated a previous research that studied project dispute resolution satisfaction (DRS) using multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA). This paper reports on a study that builds on that research, with the specific aim of predicting project DRS through the use of logistic regression (LR). In this study, a LR model of project DRS (Model 1) is developed, and then compared with the MDA model. The findings suggest that the LR technique provides a higher hit rate and thus a higher proportion of correct classification. With the wider acceptance of the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods, the effect, on the LR model, of changing the demarcation between adverse and favorable project DRS is also examined. For this examination, another LR model (Model 2) was developed. It is believed that Model 2 may reflect the prevailing sentiment that ADR is viewed as an amicable way to resolve disputes. Both the MDA model and LR models (Model 1 and Model 2) indicated that ""design changes"" are the root cause of adverse project DRS. Within the scope of the project data, these findings suggest that design changes are not just disruptive to project progress but also a critical cause of construction disputes. © 2010 ASCE.",Construction dispute resolution; Construction industry; Dispute resolution; Dispute resolution satisfaction; Logistic regression; Logistics; Multivariate discriminant analysis; Project management,Construction dispute; Dispute resolution; Logistic regression; Logistic regressions; Multivariate discriminant analysis; Construction industry; Design; Discriminant analysis; Electric reactors; Logistics; Multivariant analysis; Reconnaissance aircraft; Refrigerators; Regression analysis; Software architecture; Project management,2-s2.0-77951264342

Web provides a perfect platform which one can get information to find out the advantages and disadvantages of the product of his interest. How to automatically manage the numerous opinionated documents and then to give suggestions to the potential customers is becoming a research hotspot recently. Constructing a sentiment resource is one of the vital elements of opinion finding and polarity analysis tasks. For a specific domain, the sentiment resource can be regarded as a dictionary, which contains a list of product feature words and several opinion words with sentiment polarity for each feature word. This paper proposes an automatic algorithm to extraction feature words and opinion words for the sentiment resource. We mine the feature words and opinion words from the comments on the Web with both NLP technique and statistical method. Left context entropy is proposed to extract unknown feature words; Adjective rules and background corpus are taken into consideration in the algorithm. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed automatic sentiment resource construction approach. The proposed method that combines NLP and statistical techniques is better than using only NLP-based technique.

No standards exist for informed decision making about transplantation. Objective: To assess decision making from the perspective of caregivers of patients who faced the transplant decision before dying of cystic fibrosis or transplant complications. Design: Semistructured interviews with descriptive and qualitative content analysis.Participants- Twenty-eight caregivers of patients with cystic fibrosis who received care at our center and died between 1996 and 2006. Results: Of 28 patients who considered lung transplantation, 19 (68%) received transplants, 6 (21%) died while waiting for transplant, and 3 (11%) declined transplant. Three caregivers (11%) thought that the patient did not fully understand the reason for transplant referral. Five (18%) thought that the patient did not fully understand potential risks. Ten (36%) thought that alternatives were not fully understood. The only alternatives to transplant identified, progressive illness and the possibility of earlier death without transplant, were unacceptable to most. Thirteen caregivers (46%) reported that the patient thought that declining transplant was not an option. Caregivers described the decision as ""easy"" for 19 (68%), often expressing a sentiment of ""do or die."" Those who described the decision as ""easy"" recalled fewer elements of informed decision making. Conclusions: From caregivers' reports, patients with cystic fibrosis may not fully understand risks of and alternatives to lung transplantation.

Dennis Broe contends that the genre, with its emphasis on dark subject matter, paralleled the class conflict in labor and union movements that dominated the period. By following the evolution of film noir during the years following World War II, Broe illustrates how the noir figure represents labor as a whole. In the 1940s, both radicalized union members and protagonists of noir films were hunted and pursued by the law. Later, as labor unions achieve broad acceptance and respectability, the central noir figure shifts from fugitive criminal to law-abiding cop.

This paper investigates those changes in the case of acadja, a particular technique for intensifying fishing, which has been adopted in various parts of the developing world. Using the case of Lake Volta in Ghana, the paper investigates the social and economic impacts of this technique, looking in particular into issues of income, assets and (re)distribution of the wealth created by those acadjas. Our analysis shows that the impact of acadjas on fishing communities is mixed. While acadja certainly helps to enhance the supply of protein-rich food and may have trickle down effects at the community level, those positive contributions are greatly reduced by other more negative effects. The data show in particular that acadjas are not a poor-neutral technology in the sense that their contribution to household income seems to benefit disproportionably the wealthiest owners. As such, acadja fisheries often create negative sentiments amongst the households who cannot afford investing in this technology, creating a situation which may lead to social tension and intra-community conflicts. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This study used a qualitative approach to identify key themes derived from content analysis of 15 in-depth patient interviews about the experience of seizure recurrence. The results showed a prominence of psychological issues over medical concerns. The four most frequently expressed themes were perceived success of surgery, medication, acceptance of seizure recurrence, and personal independence. Despite seizure recurrence, patient sentiments were not universally negative; rather there was heterogeneity of views, with some reporting ambivalence and others a sense of satisfaction with outcome.

Analysis of survey data suggests that supporters of the non-nationalist challengers in the first post-violence elections expressed both strong positive associations with the past communist system and clear negative assessments of the governing record of the incumbent nationalists, sentiments that were stronger among Macedonians than among Bosniaks. Data, however, call into question popular contentions that voters' support for non-nationalists is rooted in their social tolerance or engagement in civil society.

Pooled data, based on the European Social Survey 2006/2007, is employed and analyzed by means of ordinary least squares multiple regression. The other socio-economic background variables of the model, as well as the political background, interpersonal trust and the country of origin, are controlled in order to isolate the effect of age. The analysis shows that trust in parties of 18-30 year olds is, on average, significantly higher than in the rest of the population which contradicts the assumptions of the post-modernization theory and the empirical fact that electoral participation among West European young adults is constantly decreasing. Thus, the article suggests that antipartyism and political participation should be seen as distinct processes at different birth cohorts and perhaps also at different stages of the lifecycle. © 2009 SAGE Publications.",Antipartyism; Political participation; Political trust; Western Europe; Young adults,,2-s2.0-65249150885

This study intended to investigate this notion for accuracy. METHODS: We investigated the desired gender in 92 couples who had undergone between January 2004 and December 2006 first in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles in attempts at gender selection for family balancing purposes. Their choices were then also investigated stratified for the ethnicity of the couple. RESULTS: Among 92 cycles, 36 cycles were selected for female and 56 for male (P = 0.037). An analysis based on the couples' ethnicities revealed, however, considerable differences in gender selection patterns. Especially Chinese (21 out of 22), Arab/Muslim (5 out of 6) and Asian-Indian (5 out of 5) couples primarily selected for males. Other ethnicities, however, actually preferentially selected for female gender (34 female, 25 male selections in 59 cycles). Gender choices thus varied in a statistically significant way between ethnicities (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In an ethnically mixed patient population, elective gender selection for family balancing purposes in most ethnic groups does not represent a discriminatory procedure against female equality. However, cultural biases against females are, indeed, still maintained in some minority populations. Ethics opinions should be considerate of minority opinions, but should be based on prevalent sentiments in a majority of the population. © The Author 2007.

The ultimate adoption of prohibition over competing alcohol control alternatives, as well as its eventual repeal, can best be understood with reference to particular feedback processes inherent in the institutional structure of American policymaking, which readily account for both the mad dash for prohibition and the widespread clamor for repeal, which have traditionally eluded historical explanation. © 2007 The Policy Studies Journal.",Alcohol control; Prohibition; Punctuated equilibrium theory,constitutional reform; data set; institutional framework; longitudinal gradient; policy making; policy strategy; punctuated equilibrium; social policy; theoretical study,2-s2.0-35648996378

Paul T.V.,The national security state and global terrorism: Why the state is not prepared for the new kind of war,2005,"Globalization, Security, and The Nation State: Paradigms in Transition",8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34548099612&partnerID=40&md5=52e42651f5f9c5b1a769daa0470ad328,"The effects of globalization on the national security state are multifaceted, as exemplified by the chapters in this volume. This chapter specifically addresses the question of global terrorism, a key manifestation of the transformed globalized threat environment, and its impact on the national security state. The rise of global terrorism as a major challenge to the nation-state has occurred in the context of the post-Cold War international order, characterized by the absence of a major power rivalry and near unipolarity, with the United States as the dominant power.While no nation-state is currently capable of directly challenging the U.S. dominance on a global scale, the subnational global terrorist networks with asymmetric strategies have adopted this mantle. This challenge is not an easy one to detect or defeat. In the following analysis, I present the constraints that traditional national security establishments face in fighting enemies with terrorist strategies. Asymmetric strategies rely on nonfrontal hit-and-run approaches, and targets are often selected for their visibility and political message. The smaller asymmetric challenger is not capable of or expecting substantial victory in a positional, frontal collision that is the domain of regular armed forces.What he expects is the incremental weakening of the nation-state that he is challenging. The terrorist attacks on the U.S. in September 2001 were based on asymmetrical strategy by a global network and they have suddenly raised several challenges in security policymaking for states around the world. Although terrorism is not a new phenomenon in world politics, and terrorists have been ravaging established states in many parts of the world for decades, the magnitude of the attacks, the suddenness of their impact, the massive casualties and the intensity of property destruction they caused, and the high-value nature of the targets (symbols of global and American capitalism, the World Trade Center, and the headquarters of the American military establishment, the Pentagon), all gave the attacks a much greater significance than any previous episodes of terrorism. Despite warnings by specialists and media analysts of the possibility of cataclysmic terrorist acts in the United States for well over a decade, policy planners in both the military and civilian realms were caught by surprise. The policymakers seemed to be under the misapprehension that the most likely route of massive attacks by terrorist groups would be the use of weapons of mass destruction against urban targets. The unusual instrument of the terrorist acts, commercial aircraft fully loaded with jet fuel, was not considered a serious possibility, since, barring individual instances on a much smaller scale in the Middle East and South Asia, terrorists until September 11 rarely used suicide as a means for causing massive destruction. The apparent unpreparedness of the United States to prevent and confront terrorist attacks occurred in a context in which both policymakers and scholars have been generally focused on nation-states as the central makers or breakers of security. From a state-centric security point of view, substate actors could engage in nibbling activities on the periphery, often causing limited security challenges, but they were not perceived as a threat to the domestic security of states, especially in North America and Europe. Countries in protracted zones of conflict, such as Israel, India, and Russia, have long lived with terrorism, often initiated by terrorist groups sponsored by homegrown movements or adversarial states. But terrorism in the latter two countries has been confined largely to specific provinces such as Kashmir and Chechnya, without causing much of a global impact. Terrorist activities from the key breeding ground in the geographical arc stretching from the Middle East to Southeast Asia took a while to reach North America in their intense form. In this chapter, I argue that most national military organizations, especially Western ones, are not fully equipped to meet the new security challenge posed by transnational terrorism. For more than a century, leading Western powers have structured their military forces and operational plans on Clausewitzian rational assumptions. Their defense policies have been very much state-centric because it is states that have traditionally posed the major security challenges to each other. War has been conducted by territorially organized states, often for rational purposes, and peace has been attained through postwar settlements (Holsti, 1996). In the Clausewitzian world, ""war is politics by other means"" in which opponents array forces to make political, economic, or territorial gains through the use or threat of organized violence. For well over two hundred years, the main Western conception of security has been state-centric. At least since 1792, warfare has been national, fought by citizen armies against similar forces of nation-states. In most Western countries, ""the army reflected the state. . . . The officers whose incentive was honor, class consciousness, glory or ambition and soldiers enlisted for long terms who fought as a business for a living, who were thought incapable of higher sentiments, and whose strongest attachment was usually a kind of naive pride in their regiments"" (Palmer, 1971: 50). Because war has been ""organized violence carried on by political units against each other"" (Bull, 1977: 184), the main purpose of military force has been to confront other similarly organized military forces of enemy states. As Bull characterizes it: ""it is war and the threat of war that help to determine whether particular states survive or are eliminated, whether they rise or decline, whether their frontiers remain the same or are changed, whether their peoples are ruled by one government or another, whether disputes are settled or drag on, and which way they are settled, whether there is a balance of power in the international system or one state becomes preponderant"" (1977: 187). Since the Napoleanic era, leading Western strategic analysts, from Henri Jomini to Karl von Clausewitz to Basil Liddell Hart, have spoken in rational terms when discussing war and its conduct (Moran, 2002: 17-74). To them, war has been an instrument of state policy to maximize territorial, political, or economic gains. To Clausewitz, war was an ""act of force to compel our enemy to do our will"" (1976: 75). The political culture assumed in Clausewitz's On War was state-centric. For Clausewitz, the European states were the principal actors, with strong central governments, armies, commanders, and populations mobilized politically, under the direction of a powerful state (Gray, 1999: 102). Although the colonial European armies sometimes fought guerrilla forces in the colonies and were able to adopt flexible strategies, the principal nature of the organization of warfare remained largely intact (Porch, 2000). The United States also imbibed these notions of warfare. From the U.S. historical perspective, war meant total war, and victory in war implied victory over nation-state enemies, often achieved through the use of massive air power (Brodie, 1946). The Cold War conflict reinforced the state-centric approach to security. The arrival of the nuclear age made it all the more imperative that states remain the principal possessors and managers of security. The bipolar competition under the leadership of the two superpowers also meant the broad control of Moscow and Washington over the conduct of military forces of the allied states. The Cold War was waged between states, organized as two competing blocs that quarreled over political and strategic objectives. Both the superpowers knew that they could hurt each other if they crossed a certain line in their conflict. They could engage in crisis behavior, but, when the crisis was about to get out of hand, they could sit down and negotiate and manage the endgame, thereby precluding an all-out war. Large military and institutional structures were created to conduct the Cold War conflict, deter potential wars, and influence global politics involving secondary actors. No effective subnational challenge emerged to their dominance, as the superpowers managed to maintain their aura of invincibility. In the Soviet case, effective control over its empire in Eastern Europe was often achieved through coercive means. With the demise of the Cold War, this situation has changed. As the possibility of a major-power war declined dramatically, large military organizations with the primary mission of fighting interstate wars became somewhat redundant. The new security challenges that arose, be they transnational terrorism, drug trafficking, illegal migration, or ethnic conflicts, all required new or modified instruments to combat them. In the meantime, the number of interstate wars began to decline, although there is dispute over whether the waning of major wars is a reality or a temporary phenomenon (Vayrynen, forthcoming). Most of the new wars of the post-Cold War era have been characterized by a blurring of the distinction between interstate wars, organized crime, and large-scale violations of human rights.While the main issue of contention has been identity politics, the weapons have been a combination of the old and the new and the units of combat have not been vertically organized hierarchical entities (Kaldor, 1999). © 2005 State University of New York.

Because of recent terrorist activities and intelligence information, there is strong sentiment that it is not a question of if, but when, a radiological or nuclear terrorist attack will occur. As a result, there is considerable concern that the federal government may not be adequately prepared to respond to an attack involving a radiological dispersal device or improvised nuclear device. In response to these concerns, federal departments and agencies have initiated actions to develop a better understanding of the magnitude of the radiological/nuclear terrorist threat, assess the ability of the federal government to support state and local responses to such attacks, and improve the Nation's ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from these types of attacks. In an era of limited fiscal growth and competing priorities, the federal government will have to enhance its collaboration with state and local governments, the private sector, and academia to ensure that the Nation is capable of responding to a terrorist attack involving radioactive or nuclear material.

Moral sentiments can be reasonably measured in many situations and their consideration can improve benefit-cost analysis in any case. This argument is presented by briefly considering measurement issues and the example of discount rates for long-term projects in the context of a benefit-cost analysis. The suggestion has been made that it is immoral and unethical to undervalue future generations by discounting, and recently the federal government has recognized these moral concerns about discounting. Yet, the logic of wealth maximization requires discounting. This dilemma may be resolved by realizing that the problem is one of larger concern over missing values that arise from the general tendency of benefit-cost analyses to ignore ethical values. This deficiency is overcome by a modification to benefit-cost analysis (called KHM, for Kaldor-Hicks-Moral) that incorporates moral values directly into the benefit-cost analysis and, inter alia, recognizes all values for which there is a willingness to pay. Insofar as the current generation is willing to pay to avoid future moral harm, this is incorporated into the KHM approach. This article illustrates how KHM incorporates missing values and shows how compensation and mitigation can eliminate or reduce the concern over moral harm to future generations. Thus it is not necessary to use lower discount rates to recognize moral harm. © Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2005.",,cost-benefit analysis; discount rate; policy analysis,2-s2.0-30344443985

It is shown that adaptation of preference increases the ""evaluation gap"" between the two measures. Risk exposure generally does not lead to a more generous evaluation of the poverty line or to a narrower evaluation gap. Positive sentiments toward redistribution are connected with a generous assessment of the poverty line and a small evaluation gap.

The Court reaffirmed the imposition of the death penalty for juveniles 16 and 17, while reversing itself on the mentally retarded. In reaching its decision, the Court relied on society's ""evolving standards of decency."" Using Likert-type items, this study is the first to have prospective jurors assess support for the death penalty for these specific offender groups. The public's support for the execution of each of the groups is then compared with existing case law. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses indicate that, as expected, the levels of support for the applicability of capital punishment to the various special offender populations are much lower than that for the general adult offender. Moreover, these findings are congruent with the holdings of the Court with one notable exception: a slight majority of respondents supported executing the mentally incompetent. Reasons for the public's apparent departure from the Supreme Court holding prohibiting the execution of mentally incompetent convicted murderers are discussed.

DESIGN: A qualitative, heuristic approach that subscribed to the basic tenets of descriptive phenomenology, in which teenagers were allowed to discuss in their own words the sentiments, opinions, ideologies, and intentions that affected their sexual decision-making. SETTING: Data collection consisted of a series of audiotaped interviews conducted by the researcher in the participants' homes over an 8-week period from November 1997 through January 1998. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 8 teenage mothers who met the inclusion criteria for having participated in unprotected sex at the time of conception, recruited from a facility specializing in education, support, and intervention for teenage parents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Thematic analysis of transcribed text began once the first interview was completed and continued throughout the data collection process. The process included open coding of key words and phrases, bracketing out conventional knowledge, and immersion in the data in order to identify prevalent and recurring themes. RESULTS: Results are reported in terms of the six prevalent themes that emerged from the interview data relevant to factors which contributed to the teenagers' participation in unprotected sexual intercourse: Desiring Pregnancy, Handing It Over to Fate, Lacking a Plan, Doubting the Chances, Fearing Harm, and Fearing Loss. CONCLUSIONS: Key themes identified in this study represent a foundational step in achieving a more cogent view of the issues involved in adolescent sexual decision-making. Awareness of these experiences and intentions can be used to enhance meaningful interaction between adolescents and the health care system as well as to serve as a resource in the development and implementation of programs designed to prevent adolescent pregnancy.

It is true that SK's earnings based on U.K. GAAP have been greater than SK's U.S. GAAP earnings in every year since the merger, and that information about SK's U.K. GAAP earnings does not appear to be useful for predicting what SK's U.S. GAAP earnings will be.

The National Study of Black College Students (NSBCS) is employed to develop a model that distinguishes between high- and low-performing black undergraduates attending public, four-year institutions. In the NSBCS sample (N=695), discriminant function analysis identifies several institutional and student characteristics which are related to black students' educational outcomes. Specifically, students with both high occupational aspirations and high academic performances tend to be male, attend comparatively larger schools, and, to a lesser degree, be relatively well-adjusted upperclassmen. When academic performance is the sole issue, it is positively correlated with institutional quality, but the advantage belongs to black females. Contrary to the suggestions of previous research, black community sentiment did not have relationships with educational outcomes to the extent expected.

While noting important differences in content and structure which have influenced the relative positions of women in each society, it was found that patriarchy constitutes an essential element of both religious traditions. Jewish, Christian, and Islamic doctrines manifest similar themes of female inferiority paradoxically mixed with fears of female sexual power and wile, leading to the imposition of norms which preserve male control, such as female exclusion from public participation and restriction to dependent familial roles. Religious revivals in both cultures are characterized by resurrection of these patriarchal themes, thus explaining the return to the veil by some Muslim women and the anti-feminist sentiments of Christian fundamentalists in the United States. An additional point made by this study is that women function as symbols of cultural and religious identity. Traditional female roles as caretakers of the family, despite their lower valuation in the status hierarchy, constitute the bedrock of human social organization, and an important referent for individual identity. Levi-Strauss, in his classic work, The Elementary Structures of Kinship67 characterized the exchange of females by male-controlled kinship groups as the foundation of human social organization. Thus, while females have less authority than males, they paradoxically remain powerful objects of kinship exchanges, thus becoming targets of exaggerated male control during periods of social disorganization. Large-scale social upheaval triggers the demand for a reintegration of the self within a stable meaning system, and consequently thrusts the ideology of traditional womanhood to a prominent position in the revival movement. Moreover, challenges to traditional female roles can themselves instigate a resurgence of religious fervor, underscoring the centrality of female subservience and domesticity to religious and cultural identity. In the Muslim region, for example, we have noted the stimulation of religious revivals by policies liberating women from seclusion and male hegemony, intensified in all likelihood by the perception that such policies represented foreign-inspired assaults on the integrity of Islam. An equally plausible hypothesis is that American Christian revivals have been provoked in part by challenges to traditional female domesticity embodied in the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century and the feminist movement of the late 1960's. Thus, this study has tentatively identified some factors which may precipitate revivals of traditional religious and patriarchal sentiments. Additional cross-cultural analysis is needed to elaborate and specify the conditions under which these social movements occur and their consequent effects on women's roles. Finally, this research suggests some theoretical revisions for the more general process of societal development. Prevailing theories of modernization, particularly those influenced by the functionalist perspective, have tended to conceptualize tradition and modernity as contrasting ideal types, equating modernity with a host of structural and cognitive transformations including secularization and female equality.68 Evidence from the United States suggests that the developed nations are neither immune to significant religious revivals nor unilaterally dedicated to women's rights. In the developing world, Muslim leaders have found that Islamic revival is not an impediment to national development, but may in fact provide sacred legitimation for potentially disruptive social change.69 Industrial development, urbanization, and the diffusion of economic rationality may thus coexist with intense religious devotion and popular support for patriarchal traditions. © 1984, Brill.

As such, incorporating user and product information would be helpful for the task of sentiment classification of reviews. However, existing approaches ignored the temporal nature of reviews posted by the same user or evaluated on the same product. We argue that the temporal relations of reviews might be potentially useful for learning user and product embedding and thus propose employing a sequence model to embed these temporal relations into user and product representations so as to improve the performance of document-level sentiment analysis. Specifically, we first learn a distributed representation of each review by a one-dimensional convolutional neural network. Then, taking these representations as pretrained vectors, we use a recurrent neural network with gated recurrent units to learn distributed representations of users and products. Finally, we feed the user, product and review representations into a machine learning classifier for sentiment classification.

Identifying student patterns related to course completion may help to develop interventions that can improve retention and learning outcomes in MOOCs. Previous research predicting MOOC completion has focused on click-stream data, student demographics, and natural language processing (NLP) analyses. However, most of these analyses have not taken full advantage of the multiple types of data available. This study combines click-stream data and NLP approaches to examine if students' on-line activity and the language they produce in the online discussion forum is predictive of successful class completion. We study this analysis in the context of a subsample of 320 students who completed at least one graded assignment and produced at least 50 words in discussion forums, in a MOOC on educational data mining. The findings indicate that a mix of clickstream data and NLP indices can predict with substantial accuracy (78%) whether students complete the MOOC. This predictive power suggests that student interaction data and language data within a MOOC can help us both to understand student retention in MOOCs and to develop automated signals of student success. © 2016 ACM.",Click-stream data; Educational data mining; Educational success; MOOC; Natural language processing; Predictive analytics; Sentiment analysis,Computational linguistics; Computer hardware description languages; Data mining; Education; Natural language processing systems; Clickstreams; Educational data mining; Educational success; MOOC; NAtural language processing; Predictive analytics; Sentiment analysis; Students,2-s2.0-84976466253

This paper argues that, alongside assessments of the affective valence of social media content as negative or positive, there is a need for a deeper understanding of the context in which reactions are expressed and the specific functions that users' emotional states may reflect. To demonstrate this, we present a qualitative analysis of affective expressions on Twitter collected in Germany during the 2011 EHEC food contamination incident based on a coding scheme developed from Skinner et al.'s (2003) coping classification framework. Affective expressions of coping were found to be diverse not only in terms of valence but also in the adaptive functions they served: beyond the positive or negative tone, some people perceived the outbreak as a threat while others as a challenge to cope with. We discuss how this qualitative sentiment analysis can allow a better understanding of the way the overall situation is perceived - threat or challenge - and the resources that individuals experience having to cope with emerging demands. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, topics that evoke a certain emotion in the general public are often context-sensitive, making it difficult to train a universal classifier for all collections. A multilabeled sentiment topic model, namely, the contextual sentiment topic model (CSTM), can be used for adaptive social emotion classification. The CSTM distinguishes context-independent topics from both a background theme, which characterizes nondiscriminative information, and a contextual theme, which characterizes context-dependent information across different collections. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of this model for the adaptive classification of social emotions. © 2001-2011 IEEE.",Adaptation models; Context modeling; Economics; Emotion recognition; Intelligent systems; Sentiment analysis,Economics; Intelligent systems; Social aspects; Adaptation models; Adaptive classification; Context independent; Context modeling; Corporate reputations; Customer preferences; Emotion recognition; Sentiment analysis; Classification (of information),2-s2.0-84961941252

This grounding of dropout in approximate Bayesian inference suggests an extension of the theoretical results, offering insights into the use of dropout with RNN models. We apply this new variational inference based dropout technique in LSTM and GRU models, assessing it on language modelling and sentiment analysis tasks.

User-generated responses to videos that directly oppose pro-anorexia communities have not yet been researched in depth. Objective: The aim was to study emotional reactions to pro-anorexia and anti-pro-anorexia online content on YouTube using sentiment analysis. Methods: Using the 50 most popular YouTube pro-anorexia and anti-pro-anorexia user channels as a starting point, we gathered data on users, their videos, and their commentators. A total of 395 anorexia videos and 12,161 comments were analyzed using positive and negative sentiments and ratings submitted by the viewers of the videos. The emotional information was automatically extracted with an automatic sentiment detection tool whose reliability was tested with human coders. Ordinary least squares regression models were used to estimate the strength of sentiments. The models controlled for the number of video views and comments, number of months the video had been on YouTube, duration of the video, uploader's activity as a video commentator, and uploader's physical location by country. Results: The 395 videos had more than 6 million views and comments by almost 8000 users. Anti-pro-anorexia video comments expressed more positive sentiments on a scale of 1 to 5 (adjusted prediction [AP] 2.15, 95% CI 2.11-2.19) than did those of pro-anorexia videos (AP 2.02, 95% CI 1.98-2.06). Anti-pro-anorexia videos also received more likes (AP 181.02, 95% CI 155.19-206.85) than pro-anorexia videos (AP 31.22, 95% CI 31.22-37.81). Negative sentiments and video dislikes were equally distributed in responses to both pro-anorexia and anti-pro-anorexia videos. Conclusions: Despite pro-anorexia content being widespread on YouTube, videos promoting help for anorexia and opposing the pro-anorexia community were more popular, gaining more positive feedback and comments than pro-anorexia videos. Thus, the anti-pro-anorexia content provided a user-generated counterforce against pro-anorexia content on YouTube.

Using trend and sentiment analysis is one method whereby researchers can identify changes in public perception that can be used to enhance the development of a social consciousness towards a specific public interest. The following study assessed Relative search volume (RSV) patterns for global warming (GW) and Climate change (CC) to determine public knowledge and awareness of these terms. In conjunction with this, the researchers looked at the sentiment connected to these terms in social media networks. It was found that there was a relationship between the awareness of the information and the amount of publicity generated around the terminology. Furthermore, the primary driver for the increase in awareness was an increase in publicity in either a positive or a negative light. Sentiment analysis further confirmed that the primary emotive connections to the words were derived from the original context in which the word was framed. Thus having awareness or knowledge of a topic is strongly related to its public exposure in the media, and the emotional context of this relationship is dependent on the context in which the relationship was originally established. This has value in fields like conservation, law enforcement, or other fields where the practice can and often does have two very strong emotive responses based on the context of the problems being examined. © 2015 Lineman et al.",,awareness; climate change; consciousness; driver; exposure; greenhouse effect; human; human experiment; law enforcement; mass medium; nomenclature; perception; prevalence; public opinion; scientist; social media; social network; statistics and numerical data; Climate Change; Global Warming; Humans; Public Opinion; Social Media,2-s2.0-84947996819

However, the metrics used in the sentiment analysis only classify a sentence with positive, neutral or negative intensity, and do not detect sentiment variations in accordance with the user's profile. In this arena, this paper presents a music recommendation system based on a sentiment intensity metric, named enhanced Sentiment Metric (eSM) that is the association of a lexicon-based sentiment metric with a correction factor based on the user's profile. This correction factor is discovered by means of subjective tests, conducted in a laboratory environment. Based on the experimental results, the correction factor is formulated and used to adjust the final sentiment intensity. The users' sentiments are extracted from sentences posted on social networks and the music recommendation system is performed through a framework of low complexity for mobile devices, which suggests songs based on the current user's sentiment intensity. Also, the framework was built considering ergonomic criteria of usability. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated with remote users using the crowdsourcing method, reaching a rating of 91% of user satisfaction, outperforming a randomly assigned song suggestion that reached 65% of user satisfaction. Furthermore, the paper presents low perceived impacts on the analysis of energy consumption, network and latency in accordance with the processing and memory perception of the recommendation system, showing advantages for the consumer electronic world. © 1975-2011 IEEE.",Mobile Devices; Recommendation System; Sentiment Analysis; Social Network,Complex networks; Data mining; Energy utilization; Internet; Mobile devices; Social networking (online); Correction factors; Crowdsourcing; Internet services; Laboratory environment; Music Recommendation System; Sentiment analysis; User satisfaction; User's profiles; Recommender systems,2-s2.0-84945127927

However, processing large amounts of data generated on these sites in real-time poses a difficult challenge. To cope with the data deluge, analytics companies and researchers are increasingly resorting to sampling. In this article, we investigate the crucial question of how to sample content streams generated by users in online social networks. The traditional method is to randomly sample all the data. For example, most studies using Twitter data today rely on the 1% and 10% randomly sampled streams of tweets that are provided by Twitter. In this paper, we analyze a different sampling methodology, one where content is gathered only from a relatively small sample (<1%) of the user population, namely, the expert users. Over the duration of a month, we gathered tweets from over 500,000 Twitter users who are identified as experts on a diverse set of topics, and compared the resulting expert sampled tweets with the 1% randomly sampled tweets provided publicly by Twitter. We compared the sampled datasets along several dimensions, including the popularity, topical diversity, trustworthiness, and timeliness of the information contained within them, and on the sentiment/opinion expressed on specific topics. Our analysis reveals several important differences in data obtained through the different sampling methodologies, which have serious implications for applications such as topical search, trustworthy content recommendations, breaking news detection, and opinion mining. © 2015 ACM.",Random sampling; Sampling content streams; Sampling from experts; Twitter; Twitter lists,Data mining; Importance sampling; Websites; Business analytics; Content recommendations; Large amounts of data; On-line social networks; Random sampling; Social networking sites; Twitter; Twitter lists; Social networking (online),2-s2.0-84931270016

Design, setting and participants: A cross-sectional survey involved 121 Aboriginal smokers, aged 18-45 years from January to May 2014, interviewed at community events on the Mid-North Coast NSW. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected on smoking and quitting attitudes, behaviours and home smoking rules. Perceived efficacy for quitting, and perceived threat from smoking, were uniquely assessed with a validated Risk Behaviour Diagnosis (RBD) Scale. Main outcome measures: Logistic regression explored the impact of perceived efficacy, perceived threat and consulting previously with a doctor or health professional (HP) on self-reported intentions to quit smoking, controlling for potential confounders, that is, protection responses and fear control responses, home smoking rules, gender and age. Participants' comments regarding smoking and quitting were investigated via inductive analysis, with the assistance of Aboriginal researchers. Results: Two-thirds of smokers intended to quit within 3 months. Perceived efficacy (OR=4.8; 95% CI 1.78 to 12.93) and consulting previously with a doctor/HP about quitting (OR=3.82; 95% CI 1.43 to 10.2) were significant predictors of intentions to quit. 'Smoking is not doing harm right now' was inversely associated with quit intentions (OR=0.25; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.8). Among those who reported making a quit attempt, after consulting with a doctor/HP, 40% (22/60) rated the professional support received as low (0-2/10). Qualitative themes were: the negatives of smoking (ie, disgust, regret, dependence and stigma), health effects and awareness, quitting, denial, 'smoking helps me cope' and social aspects of smoking. Conclusions: Perceived efficacy and consulting with a doctor/HP about quitting may be important predictors of intentions to quit smoking in Aboriginal smokers of reproductive age. Professional support was generally perceived to be low; thus, it could be improved for these Aboriginal smokers. Aboriginal participants expressed strong sentiments about smoking and quitting. © 2015, BMJ.

Over the past decade, researchers and political commentators have observed an apparent retreat from multiculturalist policies related to a belief that multiculturalism has lost support among the majority public. Recently, however, based on analyses of the evolution of migrant integration policies, it has been demonstrated that multiculturalist policies were largely left in place. To investigate the effect of multiculturalist policies on public opinion, we use a multilevel analysis of three policy indicators (Multiculturalism Policy Index, Index of Citizenship Rights for Immigrants–Cultural diversity, and Migrant Integration Policy Index) and European Social Survey data in 20 European countries. Results show that multiculturalist policies, as measured by Multiculturalism Policy Index and Index of Citizenship Rights for Immigrants–Cultural diversity, and migrant integration policies more generally, as measured by Migrant Integration Policy Index, to some extent are associated with lower levels of anti-immigrant sentiments, while they do not affect public attitudes toward political institutions. Regarding political attitudes, especially respondents with higher education levels tend to respond in a more positive manner to multiculturalist policies than respondents with lower education levels. © 2015 SAGE Publications",Europe; integration policy; multiculturalism; public opinion,,2-s2.0-84927786394

The authors aim to create a fine-grained corpus for Chinese sentiment analysis, and more importantly, explore new sentiment analysis tasks by analyzing the annotated corpus.

Based on this scheme, this corpus can provide a more fine-grained platform for researchers to study algorithms for advanced applications.

However, this assumption will greatly hinder the practical application of the learned model for cross-domain data analysis in multimedia. To deal with this issue, transfer learning based technology should be adopted. As a typical version of transfer learning, domain adaption has been extensively studied recently due to its theoretical value and practical interest. In this article, we propose a boosted multifeature learning (BMFL) approach to iteratively learn multiple representations within a boosting procedure for unsupervised domain adaption. The proposed BMFL method has a number of properties. (1) It reuses all instances with different weights assigned by the previous boosting iteration and avoids discarding labeled instances as in conventional methods. (2) It models the instance weight distribution effectively by considering the classification error and the domain similarity, which facilitates learning new feature representation to correct the previously misclassified instances. (3) It learns multiple different feature representations to effectively bridge the source and target domains. We evaluate the BMFL by comparing its performance on three applications: image classification, sentiment classification and spam filtering. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BMFL algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art domain adaption methods. © 2015 ACM 1551-6857/2015/01-ART33 $15.00.",Boosting; Denoising auto-encoder; Domain adaptation; Multifeature,Algorithms; Image classification; Auto encoders; Boosting; Classification errors; Domain adaptation; Feature representation; Multi features; Multiple representation; Sentiment classification; Iterative methods,2-s2.0-84923341321

The motivation of this study hinges on the growing popularity of the use of Twitter and the increasing prevalence of its influence among the financial investment community. This paper presents empirical evidence of the existence of a financial community on Twitter in which users’ interests align with financial market-related topics. We establish a methodology to identify relevant Twitter users who form the financial community, and we also present the empirical findings of network characteristics of the financial community. We observe that this financial community behaves similarly to a small-world network, and we further identify groups of critical nodes and analyse their influence within the financial community based on several network centrality measures. Using a novel sentiment analysis algorithm, we construct a weighted sentiment measure using tweet messages from these critical nodes, and we discover that it is significantly correlated with the returns of the major financial market indices. By forming a financial community within the Twitter universe, we argue that the influential Twitter users within the financial community provide a proxy for the relationship between social sentiment and financial market movement. Hence, we conclude that the weighted sentiment constructed from these critical nodes within the financial community provides a more robust predictor of financial markets than the general social sentiment. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",Financial community; Network analysis; Network centrality; Regression analysis; Sentiment analysis; Twitter; Volatility,,2-s2.0-84941784126

In this paper, we are addressing the issue of spreading public concernabout epidemics. Public concern about a communicable disease can be seen as a problem of its own. Keeping track of trends in concern about public health and identifying peaks of public concern are therefore crucial tasks. However, monitoring public health concerns is not only expensive with traditional surveillance systems, but also suffers from limited coverage and significant delays. To address these problems, we are using Twitter messages, which are available free of cost, are generated world-wide, and are posted in real time. We are measuring public concern using a two-step sentiment classification approach. In the first step, we distinguish Personal tweets from News (i.e., Non-Personal) tweets. In the second step, we further separate Personal Negative from Personal Non-Negative tweets. Both these steps consist themselves of two sub-steps. In the first sub-step (of both steps), our programs automatically generate training data using an emotion-oriented, clue-based method. In the second sub-step, we are training and testing three different Machine Learning (ML) models with the training data from the first sub-step; this allows us to determine the best ML model for different datasets. Furthermore, we are testing the already trained ML models with a human annotated, disjoint dataset. Based on the number of tweets classified as Personal Negative, we compute a Measure of Concern (MOC) and a timeline of the MOC. We attempt to correlate peaks of the MOC timeline to peaks of the News (Non-Personal) timeline. Our best accuracy results are achieved using the two-step method with a Naïve Bayes classifier for the Epidemic domain (six datasets) and the Mental Health domain (three datasets). © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.",Automatic sentiment labeling; Measure of concern; Public health; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Social analytics; Twitter mining,,2-s2.0-84947296805

This may significantly impact several applications including opinion mining, sentiment analysis, etc., as data collection tasks such as opinion retrieval tasks will fail to obtain all the relevant messages whenever the target topic, objects, or features are not explicit within the texts. In order to address these issues, in this paper a novel adaptive approach for opinion retrieval is proposed. It combines natural-language co-referencing techniques, features-based linguistic preprocessing and memory-based learning to resolving implicit co-referencing within informal opinion texts by using underlying hierarchies of thread messages. Experiments were conducted to assess the ability of the model to improve opinion retrieval by resolving implicit entities and features, showing the promise of our opinion retrieval approach when compared to state-of-the-art methods using text data from social networks. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Linguistic coreferencing; Memory-based learning; Natural language processing; Opinion mining; Opinion retrieval; Text mining,Computational linguistics; Data mining; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Text processing; Memory-based learning; NAtural language processing; Opinion mining; Opinion retrievals; Text mining; Information retrieval,2-s2.0-84924859220

We used a self-organizing map to analyze word frequency data derived from users' forum posts. We then introduced a novel network-based approach for modeling users' forum interactions and employed a network partitioning method based on optimizing a stability quality measure. This allowed us to determine consumer opinion and identify influential users within the retrieved modules using information derived from both word-frequency data and network-based properties.

Questions have been raised regarding analysts' ability to generate new information beyond recent corporate events. Employing a comprehensive database on corporate news, we show that only a small minority, or 27.9%, of all recommendation revisions directionally confirm the information in the preceding corporate events and even these ""confirming revisions"" facilitate the information discovery of corporate events and thus cannot simply be dismissed as ""piggybacking."" Our analysis further shows that analysts not only facilitate price discovery to corporate news through issuing trending revisions but also help reverse prevailing market sentiments following corporate news by issuing contrarian revisions. Our study is the first to investigate short-window intraday market reactions to revisions issued after hours, which account for 70% of all recommendation revisions in our sample period. Analysts' incentives to issue revisions after hours appear to reflect demands from large institutional clients, who dominate after-hours trading. More importantly, we show that the after-hours revisions are associated with significantly greater price reactions and different price reaction patterns than revisions issued during regular trading hours. Collectively, our evidence indicates that analysts are a significant source of new information beyond recent corporate news and they also help shape the market's assessment of corporate disclosures. © 2015 The Accounting Research Center at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.",After-hours revisions; G11; G12; G14; G24; M41; Piggybacking; Security analysts; Stock recommendation,,2-s2.0-84939651428

To find the best model for automatic analysis we look at four aspects: preprocessing, features, machine learning techniques and the use of the neutral class.

Motivation behind sentiment analysis is that it provides companies’ methods to determine the product acceptance and ways to improve its quality. It also helps users to take purchasing decisions. Various parsing schemes/ feature extraction methods have been proposed in the literature to process unstructured text to extract patterns that may help machine learning model to learn. The main limitation of the existing feature extraction techniques is the sparseness of the data and inability to incorporate semantic information. In this paper, a new feature extraction method is proposed, namely clustering features. Proposed feature extraction technique focuses on alleviating the data sparsity faced by supervised sentiment analysis by clustering of semantic features. Proposed clustering features are capable of including semantic information and alleviating data sparseness for machine learning algorithm. In all the experiments, support vector machine and Boolean Multinomial Naive Bayes (BMNB) machine learning algorithms are used for classification.

The ‘conservative turn’ in Russian politics is associated with the return to the cultural and political ideologeme of Katechon, which is proposed by several right-wing intellectuals as the basis for the Russia's new state ideology and foreign and security policy. The theological concept of Katechon (from the Greek ό Κατέχων, ‘the withholding’) that protects the world from the advent of the Antichrist originates in the Byzantine Empire. In Russian tradition, this concept is presented in the well-known doctrine of Moscow as the Third Rome, dating back to the 16th century. The term ‘Katechon’ in contemporary Russian political discourse is relatively new and can be traced to the post-Soviet reception of Carl Schmitt's political theology. The concept of Russia as Katechon is directly connected to the national security and defence policy, because it is used as the ideological ground for the new wave of militarization and anti-Western sentiment, as well as for Russia's actions during the Ukrainian crisis. This analysis puts the internal political and cultural debate on Russia's role in international affairs and its relations with the West into historical perspective and demonstrates the right-wing intellectual circles’ influence on the Kremlin's new domestic and foreign policy. © 2014, Taylor & Francis.",,,2-s2.0-84911937708

Amazon alone provides access to millions of reviews, risking to cause information overload to an average user. Recent research has thus aimed at under- standing and identifying reviews that are considered helpful.

We believe that insight about influence can be gained from analyzing the affective content of the text as well as affect intensity. We employ text mining to extract the emotionality of 68,049 hotel reviews in order to investigate how those inuencers behave, especially their choice of words. We analyze whether texts with words and phrases indicative of a writer's emo- Tions, moods, and attitudes are more likely to trigger a gen- uine interest compared to more neutral texts. Our initial hypothesis was that influential writers are more likely to re- frain themselves from expressing their sentiments in order to achieve a more perceived objectivity.

By means of a literature review on early works related to social media analytics especially on opinion mining, it was recognized that in the real life social media environment, the structure of the data is commonly not clear and it does not directly generate enough information to fully represent any selected target. However, most of these works were unable to accurately extract clear indications of general public opinion from the ambiguous social media data. They also lacked the capacity to summarize multi-characteristics from the scattered mass of social data and use it to compile useful models, also lacked any efficient mechanism for managing the big data. Motivated by these research problems, this paper proposes a novel matrix-based fuzzy algorithm, called the FMM system, to mine the defined multi-layered Twitter data. Through sets of comparable experiments applied on Twitter data, the proposed FMM system achieved an excellent performance, with both fast processing speeds and high predictive accuracy. © 2014 IEEE.",Big data; Data mining; Social media analytics,Algorithms; Big data; Computation theory; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy sets; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Fuzzy logic approach; Literature reviews; Multi characteristics; Predictive accuracy; Public sentiments; Research problems; Social media analytics; Social media datum; Data mining,2-s2.0-84946687335

Violent anti-Chinese feelings are frequently explained as a consequence of China’s meteoric economic development, a cause of much anxiety for her immediate neighbors and particularly for Mongolia, a large but sparsely populated country that is rich in mineral resources. Other analysts point to deeply entrenched antagonisms and to centuries of hostility between the two groups, implying unbridgeable cultural differences. Franck Billé challenges these reductive explanations. Through an in-depth analysis of media discourses, Billé shows how stereotypes of the Chinese emerged through an internalization of Russian ideas of Asia, and how they can easily extend to other Asian groups such as Koreans or Vietnamese. He argues that the anti-Chinese attitudes of Mongols reflect an essential desire to distance themselves from Asia overall and to reject their own Asianness. The spectral presence of China, imagined to be everywhere and potentially in everyone, thus produces a pervasive climate of mistrust, suspicion, and paranoia. © 2015 University of Hawai’i Press.

Fortunately, review quality evaluation enables a system to recommend automatically the most helpful reviews to users. Previous studies predict only the overall review utility about a product, and often focus on developing different data features to learn a quality function for the problem. In this paper, we aim to select the most helpful reviews not only at the product level, but also at a fine-grained product aspect level. We propose a novel super-vised joint aspect and sentiment model (SJASM), which is a probabilistic topic modeling framework that jointly discovers aspects and sentiments guided by a review helpfulness metric. One key advantage of SJASM is its ability to infer the underlying aspects and sentiments, which are indicative of the helpfulness of a review. We validate SJASM using publicly available review data, and our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SJASM over several competing models.

The results indicate that tag cloud, frequency map, attitudes pie, individual mention ratios, and dissemination flow graph, based on the crawled information and data processing not only highlight the characteristics of geo-event itself, but also implicate many interesting phenomenon and deep-seated problems behind it, such as related topics, theme vocabularies, subject contents, hot countries, event bodies, opinion leaders, high-frequency vocabularies, information sources, semantic structure, propagation paths, distribution of different attitudes, and regional difference of net citizens' response in the Huangyan Island incident. Furthermore, the text analysis of network information with the help of focused web crawler is able to express the time-space relationship of crawled information and the information characteristic of semantic network to the geo-events. Therefore, it is a useful tool to collect information for understanding the formation and diffusion of web-based public opinions in political events. © 2014 by the authors.",Huangyan island incident; Sentiment analysis; Text information; Web crawler technology,automation; data acquisition; educational development; geological record; graphical method; information system; island; social network; China; Huangyan; Zhejiang,2-s2.0-84899146981

This new digital landscape, combined with the ubiquitous online access potential of modern devices, provides novel capabilities to online users and allows them to express their opinions and attitudes about everything in almost real time. In this paper, we present an investigation on the use of social media for the continuous monitoring and mining of consumer behaviour. We analyse hundreds of thousands of microblogging messages containing comments, sentiments and opinions about food and brand products. We present initial results, which confirm previous studies about the potential of using social media monitoring for branding purposes. The results provide strong indications that given the use of such services by millions of users, they can play a key role in supporting and enhancing important business processes. Examples of such processes include company-to-customer relationship management, brand image building and Word-of-Mouth (WoM) branding.

Most of the existing researches focus on how to extract the effective features, such as lexical features and syntactic features, while limited work has been done on the extraction of semantic features, which can make more contributions to sentiment classification. This paper presents a method for sentiment classification based on word2vec. Word2vec is a tool, which establishes the neural network models to learn the vector representations of words in the high dimensional vector space. So it can extract the deep semantic relationships between words. In this paper, firstly, we cluster the similar features together using word2vec. And then we use word2vec again to learn the word representations as candidate feature vectors. After feature selection, the SVMperf package is adopted to train and classify the comment texts. To conduct the experiments, we collect a large number of Chinese comments on clothing products as data set. The experimental results show that the accuracy of sentiment classification is over 90 percent, which proves the effectiveness of proposed method for Chinese sentiment classification. © 2014 IEEE.",,Intelligent systems; Semantics; Neural network model; Semantic features; Semantic relationships; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Syntactic features; Vector representations; Word representations; Vector spaces,2-s2.0-84921293596

In order to exploit the fine-grained structural information of textual content, a review may be considered as a collection of sentences, each with its own sentiment orientation and score. In this manner, a score aggregation method is needed to combine sentence-level scores into an overall review rating. While recent work has concentrated on designing effective sentence-level prediction methods, there remains the problem of finding efficient algorithms for score aggregation. In this study, we investigate different aggregation methods, as well as the cases in which they perform poorly. According to the analysis of existing methods, we propose a new score aggregation method based on the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. In the proposed method, we first detect the polarity of reviews using a machine learning approach and then, consider sentence scores as evidence for the overall review rating. The results from two public social web datasets show the higher performance of our method in comparison with existing score aggregation methods and state-of-the-art machine learning approaches. © 2014 Mohammad Ehsan Basiri et al.",,Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Aggregation methods; Dempster-shafer theory of evidence; Machine learning approaches; Prediction methods; Prediction techniques; Prediction-based; Structural information; Textual content; Forecasting,2-s2.0-84901020449

However, little work has investigated how to present the sentiment information (as extracted from reviews) on the user interface, especially in the interface of supporting users to compare products. In this manuscript, we design three alternative sentiment-embedded comparison interfaces based on popular techniques, respectively called opinion table, opinion bar chart, opinion cloud. We then report results from two user studies on the developed interfaces. The first user study verified (1) the important role of comparison matrix in users' decision process, (2) the benefit of incorporating reviews into the comparison interface, and (3) the positive effect of showing features' sentiment info on aiding users' product comparison. Motivated by the first study's results, we performed the second user study to in depth compare the three alternative designs empirically. It turns out that the opinion bar chart, that mainly visualizes numerical feature sentiment scores via bars and qualitative adjective words via tool tip window, achieved significantly higher user assessments in terms of perceived information sufficiency, perceived ease of use and perceived cognitive effort. Users also behaved more active in opinion bar chart by manipulating the extracted features while less frequently viewing the raw textual reviews. The opinion cloud, that primarily visualizes the feature-associated opinion words in form of adjusted tags, was shown with better performance than opinion table, but slightly lower favor than opinion bar chart. In addition, this study revealed the effectiveness of showing opinion features (i.e., features with sentiment) in allowing users to examine the similarity and contrast across multiple products, and hence enabling them to make an informed and confident decision at the end. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, based on matrix factorization with co-occurrence neighbor regularization which is derived from context, we propose a novel non-seed model called CONR for SWI. Instead of seed words, CONR exploits two important factors: sentiment matching and sentiment consistency for sentiment word identification. Experimental results on four publicly available datasets show that CONR can outperform the state of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we use data from 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study to examine the individual-level dynamics that contributed to the heightened nationalization of the 2010 congressional elections. Our analysis shows that Tea Party support and the attribution of blame and responsibility by voters are essential to understanding the 2010 election outcome, beyond what we would expect from a simple referendum model of midterm elections. Not surprisingly, Tea Party supporters blamed Democrats for the state of national affairs, disapproved of the Democrats' policy agenda, and overwhelmingly supported Republican candidates in the congressional elections. However, our analysis shows that not all voters who supported Republican candidates were driven by high levels of opposition to President Obama and the Democrats.

Sentiment analysis in the Arabic language is a more challenging task than in other languages due to the morphological complexity of the Arabic and the large variation of its dialects. This paper presents an empirical comparison of seven feature selection methods (Information Gain, Principal Components Analysis, Relief-F, Gini Index, Uncertainty, Chi-squared, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs)), and three machine learning classifiers (SVM, Naive Bayes, and K-nearest neighbor) for Arabic sentiment classification. A wide range of comparative experiments are conducted on an opinion corpus for Arabic (OCA). This paper demonstrates that feature selection does improve the performance of Arabic sentiment-based classification, but the result depends on the method used and the number of features selected. The experimental results demonstrate that feature reduction methods are found to improve the classifier performance. Moreover, the experimental results indicate that SVM-based feature selection yields the best performance for feature selection and that the SVM classifier outperforms the other techniques for Arabic sentimentbased classification.

Design/methodology/approach: Surveys took place in two countries, South Korea (n = 257) and Taiwan (n = 258). Both are rapidly developing economies with a cosmopolitan consumer base. Two products, one representing conspicuous and one representing non-conspicuous categories, were used in each country's survey. The data were subjected to exploratory and confirmation factor analyses and fitted using structural equation modelling. Findings: Contrary to past studies, EN and COS were unrelated. Economic nationalism was strong and biased towards domestic products. The results also suggest that COS may be related to bias against domestic products. EN related strongly to normative influence, whereas COS rested on informational influence. The results were similar across the countries and the product types. Research limitations/implications: Economic nationalism and COS may coexist as consumer dispositions and their relative salience may vary across individuals. Foreign firms should not overlook consumers' nationalistic sentiment, just as domestic firms may capitalise on it. Both foreign and domestic firms can capitalise on consumer nationalism by highlighting benefits such as domestic employment and wealth creation. Practical implications: EN and COS may coexist as consumer dispositions, and their relative salience may vary across individuals. When managing their brand portfolio, foreign firms would benefit from considering consumers' nationalistic sentiment, just as domestic firms may capitalise on it. Both foreign and domestic firms can capitalise on consumer nationalism by highlighting social benefits such as domestic employment and wealth creation. Originality/value: This study brings research on EN and COS from a macro/country level to a micro/individual level.

Researchers conventionally assume these conceptualizations are interchangeable as social ties, and some employ composite measures that aim to capture more than one dimension. Even so, important discrepancies often appear for non-ties (as dyads where a specific role relation or sentiment is not reported, a specific form of interaction is not observed, or exchange is not possible). Methodology/approach Investigating the interplay across the four definitions is a step toward developing scope conditions for generalization and application of theory across these domains. Research implications This step is timely because emerging tools of computational social science wearable sensors, logs of telecommunication, online exchange, or other interaction now allow us to observe the fine-grained dynamics of interaction over time. Combined with cuttingedge methods for analysis, these lenses allow us to move beyond reified notions of social ties (and non-ties) and instead directly observe and analyze the dynamic and structural interdependencies of social interaction behavior. Originality/value of the paper This unprecedented opportunity invites us to refashion dynamic structural theories of exchange that advance ""beyond networks"" to unify previously disjoint research streams on relationships, interaction, and opportunity structures. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Interpersonal sentiments; Online exchange; Relational event modeling; Social exchange; Social interaction; Social networks,,2-s2.0-84904595958

However, if the learned model is applied on a different domain, the performance drops significantly and, given that it is impractical to have labeled corpora for every domain, this becomes a challenging task. In the current work, we address this problem, by proposing an ensemble classifier that is trained on a general domain and and adapts, without the need for additional ground truth, on the desired (test) domain before classifying a document. Our experiments are performed on three different datasets and the obtained results are compared with various baselines and state-of-the-art methods; we demonstrate that our model is outperforming all out-of-domain trained baseline algorithms, and that it is even comparable with different in-domain classifiers. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",Ensemble classifier; Polarity detection; Sentiment analysis,Social networking (online); Cross-domain; Different domains; Ensemble classifiers; Ensemble modeling; Polarity classification; Sentiment analysis; State-of-the-art methods; Training purpose; Classification (of information),2-s2.0-84921691851

Subsequently, we translate the data from English to four other languages - Italian, Spanish, French and German - using a standard machine translation system. Further on, we manually correct the test data and create Gold Standards for each of the target languages.

Most of the existing researches on feature-level opinion mining are dedicated to extract explicitly appeared features and opinion words. However, among the numerous kinds of reviews on the web, there are a significant number of reviews that contain only opinion words which imply some product features. The identification of such implicit features is still one of the most challenge tasks in opinion mining. In this paper, we propose a classification-based approach to deal with the task of implicit feature identification. Firstly, by exploiting the word segmentation, part-of-speech(POS) tagging and dependency parsing, a rule based method to extract the explicit feature-opinion pairs is presented. Secondly, the feature-opinion pairs for each opinion word are clustered and the training documents for each clustered feature-opinion pair are then constructed. Finally, the identification of implicit features is formulated into a classification-based feature selection.

The established paradigm of society espouses domination of and separation from the natural environment, and manifests in environmentally detrimental attitudes and practices. Ecological exploitation appears to stem from the same root socioeconomic processes as social injustice-the hierarchical arrangement of power which places some groups and the environment in a position devoid of power or rights. Accordingly, endorsement of social and environmental injustice is exacerbated by tendencies toward domination and hierarchy, such as social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism. Moreover, injustice is perpetuated by motivation to uphold and justify social structures and the dominant paradigm, which stifles societal change toward intergroup fairness and equality and motivates denial and neglect in the face of environmental problems. Ideological tendencies in service of the system, including political conservatism, belief in a just world, and free market ideology, contribute toward perpetuating injustice as well as anti-environmental sentiment and behavior. Considering the shared psychological and ideological underpinnings of social and environmental injustice point to important interventions, such as cultivating interdependence through contact, fostering inclusive representations, and harnessing ideological motives toward overcoming resistance to change, and carry implications for expanding the scope of justice theory, research, and practice. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Climate change; Environmental attitudes and behaviors; Ideology; Social justice; Societal hierarchy; System justification,,2-s2.0-84883557238

This problem demands efficient and scalable methods for sentiment aggregation and correlation, which account for the evolution of sentiment values, sentiment bias, and other factors associated with the special characteristics of web data. We propose a scalable approach for sentiment indexing and aggregation that works on multiple time granularities and uses incrementally updateable data structures for online operation. Furthermore, we describe efficient methods for computing meaningful sentiment correlations, which exploit pruning based on demographics and use top-k correlations compression techniques. We present an extensive experimental evaluation with both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our pruning techniques and the efficiency of our solution.

The purpose of this paper is to answer three questions. First, in what way is a service system based on service-dominant logic (SDL) superior to one based on goods-dominant logic (GDL)? Second, which characteristics of the service system facilitate the co-creation of value-in-context as perceived by the customer? Third, how do customers describe the contents of these characteristics? Design/methodology/approach – In an experiment, the authors compared two different service systems designed with different mindsets. The experiment was carried out with a group of habitual bus travellers to plan a specific journey using two online service systems by two different organizations; one exhibited a goods-dominant mindset, and the other a service-dominant mindset. The subjects' opinions of the two systems were gathered, and sentiment analysis was performed on the opinions to uncover the rationale behind the operational superiority of an SDL-based system in value co-creation. Findings – The sentiment analysis identified three key differentiators: intangibles; operant resources; and information symmetry as the reason why an SDL-based service system is superior to a GDL-based system. The study also identified specific attributes linked to the key differentiators that could be built into a service system design and verified during a review of that design. Originality/value – The paper contributes to research by: showing why an SDL based service system is superior to a GDL based one; proposing guidelines for service system design based on SDL to arrive at a favourable customer experience; and to managers by showing that customers have much to contribute in service development and realisation. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Communication technologies; Customer experience; Design; Design principle; ICT system; Information technology; Sentiment analysis; Service systems; Service-dominant logic; Value co-creation,,2-s2.0-84986052379

Text cube is a new way to organize data (e.g., Twitter text) in multiple dimensions and multiple hierarchies for efficient information query and visualization. With the HSCB measures defined in a cube, users are able to view statistical reports and perform online analytical processing. Along with viewing and analyzing Twitter text using cubes and charts, we have also added the capability to display the contents of the cube on a heat map. The degree of opacity is directly proportional to the value of the behavioral, social or cultural measure. This kind of map allows the analyst to focus attention on hotspots of concern in a region of interest.

In this paper, we investigate prospects and limitations of machine translation in sentiment analysis for cross-lingual polarity detection task. We focus on improving classification accuracy in a crosslingual setting where we have available labeled training instances about particular domain in different languages. We experiment with movie review and product review datasets consisting of polar texts in English and Turkish. The results of the study show that expanding training size with new instances taken from another corpus does not necessarily increase classification accuracy. And this happens primarily not due to (not always accurate) machine translation, but because of the inherent differences in corpora between two subsets written in different languages. Similarly, in case of co-training classification with machine translation we observe from the results that accuracy improvement can be explained by semi-supervised learning with unlabeled data coming from the same domain, but not due to cross-language co-training itself. Our results also show that amount of artificial noise added by machine translation services does not hinder classifiers much in polarity detection task. However, it is important to distinguish the effect of machine translation from the effect of merging different cross-lingual data sources and that like in case of transfer learning we may need to search for ways to account for cross-lingual data distribution differences.",Machine translation; Multi-lingual polarity detection,Data mining; Linguistics; Supervised learning; Accuracy Improvement; Classification accuracy; Cross-lingual settings; Data distribution; Machine translations; Semi-supervised learning; Sentiment analysis; Transfer learning; Computer aided language translation,2-s2.0-84890580303

In particular, the rich multimedia information accumulated in recent years provides an easy and convenient way for more active communication between people. This offers an opportunity to research people's behaviors and activities based on those multimedia content, which can be considered as social imagematics. One emerging area is driven by the fact that these massive multimedia data contain people's daily sentiments and opinions. However, existing sentiment analysis typically only pays attention to the textual information regardless of the visual content, which may be more informative in expressing people's sentiments and opinions.

Previous methods often treat a sentiment as a special topic and assume a word is generated from a flat mixture of topics, where the discriminative performance of sentiment analysis is not satisfied. A key reason is that providing rich priors on the polarity of a word for the flat mixture is difficult as the polarity often depends on the topic. To solve the problem we propose a novel model. We decompose the generative process of a word's sentiment polarity to a two-level hierarchy: the first level determines whether a word is used as a sentiment word or just an ordinary topic word, and the second level (if the word is used as a sentiment word) determines the polarity of it. With the decomposition, we provide separate prior for the the first level to encourage the discrimination between sentiment words and ordinary topic words. This prior is relatively easy to obtain compared to the concrete prior of the word polarities. We construct the prior based on part-of-speech tags of words and embed the prior into the model. Experiments on four real online review data sets show that our model consistently outperforms previous methods in the task of sentiment analysis, and simultaneously performs well in the sub-tasks of discovering ordinary topics, sentiment-specific topics, and extracting topic-specific sentiment words.",,Mixtures; Generative process; Mining topics; Online reviews; Part-of-speech tags; Second level; Sentiment analysis; Topic Modeling; Topic words; Data mining,2-s2.0-84960474837

For example, to help classify videos on Youtube, which include three views/perspectives: image, voice and subtitles, one may borrow data from Flickr, Last.FM and Google News. Although any single instance in these domains can only cover a part of the views available on Youtube, actually the piece of information carried by them may compensate with each other. In this paper, we define this transfer learning problem as Transfer Learning with Multiple Views and Multiple Sources. As different sources may have different probability distributions and different views may be compensate or inconsistent with each other, merging all data in a simplistic manner will not give optimal result. Thus, we propose a novel algorithm to leverage knowledge from different views and sources collaboratively, by letting different views from different sources complement each other through a co-training style framework, while revise the distribution differences in different domains. We conduct empirical studies on several real-world datasets to show that the proposed approach can improve the classification accuracy by up to 8% against different state-of-the-art baselines.

The result of quantitative sentiment analysis shows that sarcastic tweets are used with more positive tweets than ironic tweets. The result of content analysis corresponds to the result of quantitative sentiment analysis in identifying the aggressiveness of sarcasm. On the other hand, from content analysis it shows that irony owns two senses. The first sense of irony is equal to aggressive sarcasm with speaker awareness. Thus, tweets of first sense of irony may attack a specific target, and the speaker may tag his/her tweet irony because the tweet itself is ironic. These tweets though tagged as irony are in fact sarcastic tweets. Different from this, the tweets of second sense of irony is tagged to classify an event to be ironic. However, from the distribution in sentiment analysis and examples in content analysis, irony seems to be more broadly used in its second sense. © 2013 by Po-Ya Angela Wang.",,Content analysis; Qualitative study; Sentiment analysis; Data mining,2-s2.0-84922810278

Smith wrote two classics: The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759; hereafter Sentiments); and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776; hereafter Wealth). In Sentiments it is argued that human sociability in close-knit groups is governed by the “propriety and fitness” of conduct based on sympathy. This non-utilitarian model provides new insights into the results of 2-person experimental “trust” and other games that defied the predictions of traditional game theory in the 1980s and 90s, and offers testable new predictions. Moreover, Smith shows how the civil order of “property” grew naturally out of the rules of propriety.

When these opinions are relevant to a company, they are important sources of business insight, whether they represent critical intelligence about a customer's defection risk, the impact of an influential reviewer on other people's purchase decisions, or early feedback on product releases, company news or competitors. Capturing and analyzing these opinions is a necessity for proactive product planning, marketing and customer service and it is also critical in maintaining brand integrity. The importance of harnessing opinion is growing as consumers use technologies such as Twitter to express their views directly to other consumers. Tracking the disparate sources of opinion is hard - but even harder is quickly and accurately extracting the meaning so companies can analyze and act. Tweets' Language is complicated and contextual, especially when people are expressing opinions and requires reliable sentiment analysis based on parsing many linguistic shades of gray.

Two prominent examples are sentiment analysis and the discovery of correlated concepts. A convenient representation of information in such scenarios is in terms of concepts extracted from the unstructured data, and measures, such as sentiment scores, associated with these concepts. Typically, social media analysis reports these concepts and their associated measures. We argue that much richer insights can be obtained through the use of OLAP-style multidimensional analysis. It is fairly straightforward to see how to add traditional dimension hierarchies such as time and geography, and to analyze the data along these dimensions using traditional OLAP operations such as roll-up; for instance, to answer queries of the form ""What was the average sentiment for X in Europe during the past month?"" However, it is trickier to answer queries of the form ""What was the average sentiment for concepts related to X in Europe during the past month?"" We introduce a conceptual modeling framework that extends traditional multidimensional models and OLAP operators to address the new set of requirements for data extracted from social media. In this model, we organize data along both traditional dimensions (we call these metadata dimensions) and concept dimensions, which model relationships among concepts using parent-child hierarchies. Specifically: (i) we allow operations on parent-child hierarchies to be treated in a uniform way as operations on traditional dimension hierarchies; (ii) to model the rich relationships that can exist among concepts, we extend the parent-child hierarchies to be rooted level-DAGs rather than simply trees; and (iii) we introduce new equivalence classes that allow us to reason with ""similar"" concepts in new ways. We show that our modeling and operator framework facilitates multidimensional analysis to gain further insights from social media data than is possible with existing methods. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,Conceptual model; Conceptual modeling; Dimension hierarchies; Model relationships; Multi-dimensional model; Multidimensional analysis; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Social media analysis; Unstructured data; Data mining; Equivalence classes; Metadata; Query processing,2-s2.0-84868332140

Our classifiers mark relations between two persons (one being the topic of a biography, the other being mentioned in this biography) as positive, neutral, or unknown, and do so at an above-baseline level. A training set centering on a historically important person is contrasted against a multi-person training set; the latter is found to produce the most robust generalization performance. Frequency-ranked predictions of positive and negative relationships predicted by the best-performing classifier, presented in the form of person-centered social networks, are scored by a domain expert; the mean average precision results indicate that our system is better in classifying and ranking positive relations (around 70% MAP) than negative relations (around 40% MAP). © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

NLP is used to enable computers to attain the capability of manipulating natural languages with a level of expertise equivalent to humans. There exists a wide range of applications for NLP, of which sentiment analysis(SA) plays a major role. In sentimental analysis, the emotional polarity of a given text is analysed, and classified as positive, negative or neutral. A more difficult task is to refine the classification into different moods such as happy, sad, angry etc. Analysing a natural language for mood extraction is not at all an easy task for a computer. Even after achieving capabilities of massive amount of computation within a matter of seconds, understanding the sentiments embodied in phrases and sentences of textual information remains one of the toughest tasks for a computer till date. This paper focuses on tagging the appropriate mood in Malayalam text. Tagging is used to specify whether a sentence indicates a sad, happy or angry mood of the person involved or if the sentence contains just facts, devoid of emotions. This research work is heavily dependent on the language since the structures vary from language to language. Mood extraction and tagging has been successfully implemented for English and other European languages. For the south Indian language Malayalam, no significant work has yet been done on mood extraction. We will be focusing on domain-specific sentence-level mood extraction from Malayalam text. The extraction process involves parts-of-speech tagging of the input sentence, extracting the patterns from the input sentence which will contribute to the mood of the sentence, such as the adjective, adverb etc., and finally scoring the sentence on an emotive scale by calculating the semantic orientation of the sentence using the extracted patterns. Sentiment classification is becoming a promising topic with the rise of social media such as blogs, social networking sites, where people express their views on various topics. Mood extraction enables computers to automate the activities performed by human for making decisions based on the moods of opinions expressed in Malayalam text. © 2012 IEEE.",Malayalam; Natural Language Processing; parts-of-speech tagging; Semantic Orientation; Sentiment analysis,Malayalam; NAtural language processing; parts-of-speech tagging; Semantic orientation; Sentiment analysis; Computer science; Data mining; Semantics; Social networking (online); Natural language processing systems,2-s2.0-84867951779

While there are many forms such an assessment can take, we view it as providing insight into who are the key actors, what are the key issues, sentiments, resources, activities and locations, how have these changed in recent times, and what roles do the various actors play. We propose a mixed initiative rapid ethnographic approach that supports socio-cultural assessment through a network analysis lens. We refer to this as the data-to-model (D2M) process. In D2M, semi-automated computer-based text-mining and machine learning techniques are used to extract networks linking people, groups, issues, sentiments, resources, activities and locations from vast quantities of texts. Human-in-the-loop procedures are then used to tune and correct the extracted data and refine the computational extraction. Computational post-processing is then used to refine the extracted data and augment it with other information, such as the latitude and longitude of particular cities. This methodology is described and key challenges illustrated using three distinct data sets. We find that the data-to-model approach provides a reusable, scalable, rapid approach for generating a rapid ethnographic assessment in which human effort and coding errors are reduced, and the resulting coding can be replicated. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Agent-based simulation; Data analysis; Meta-network; Network-analysis; Newspaper data; Social-networks; Text-mining,,2-s2.0-84865438185

Results suggest that transitory shifts in debt market sentiment tend to be less important determinants of bond-yield volatility than shocks to the underlying fundamentals. In a second step, we develop a correlation and causality analysis that indicates the existence of two different groups of countries closely linked: core EMU countries and peripheral EMU countries.

The study found both task- and treatment-related implications for customer reactions to scripted service. Customers' overall sentiment toward scripting is more positive when they are focusing on task-related outcomes, but their comments turned more negative when they considered treatment-related implications, particularly when they detected employee insincerity in regard to the script. Management should consider these findings carefully because customers in this survey gave more notice to treatment-related issues than they did to task-related outcomes for the scripted service. A key implication is that managers may wish to reserve tight scripting for simple services for which efficiency is valued, such as hotel check-in or seating guests in a restaurant. For more complex services, scripts should be flexible, and managers should seek employee buy-in so that they are internalizing the script elements, rather than merely ""surface acting."" © The Author(s) 2012.",content analysis; emotional labor; service design; service encounter; service scripts,,2-s2.0-84864014579

The study examines middle and low levels of state violence, the provincial and municipal organization of party and regime, and the police, private militias, and thugs as low-level enforcers, and focuses on: (1) the complexity of the state's apparatus of repression and control and how different levels exercise different forms of violence against activists; (2) the creativity of the opposition's actions to voice its demands and avoid repression and surveillance; and (3) the recursive relationship between the two, a dark dance between state and opposition with high stakes for both. Hierarchical analysis at national, provincial, and local levels, and lateral analysis across these levels, where elite interests frequently diverge, show that intersections and gaps on both axes can create lapses in social control and openings the opposition.

The municipality consists of three local municipalities, Lesedi, Emfuleni and Midvaal. Design/methodology/approach: The sampling procedure was carefully designed, taking into account the spatial distribution of the population in the Sedibeng district municipality and the three local municipalities. A structured sample of 1,000 respondents was used for the study and descriptive and inferential statistics approaches were used. The focus was on citizen satisfaction with public service delivery in health care, housing, water, electricity, solid waste removal, community services or overall physical appearance of the community, cutting crimes and job creation. Findings: Respondents are most dissatisfied with roads maintenance, government efforts to create jobs and reduce crime. Respondents from Emfuleni local municipality hold more positive feelings about public service delivery in the area of water, electricity, and solid waste. Their most negative feeling is in the area of job creation, roads and the municipality's efforts in cutting down on crime. On balance, respondents from Lesedi hold positive feelings about public service delivery only in the area of water and electricity supplies. Similarly, their most negative feelings are in the area of job creation, roads, and the municipality's efforts in cutting crime. Respondents from Midvaal do not hold positive feelings about public service delivery in their local municipality. Similar to other two local municipalities, their most negative feelings are in the area of job creation, roads, and the municipality's efforts in cutting crime. Overall, the most negative sentiment about public service delivery has been expressed by respondents from Midvaal, followed by Emfuleni and Lesedi. Practical implications: It is important for public service delivery in Sedibeng municipality to improve so that citizens' public confidence can rise. Originality/value: Throughout Africa, governments have been entrusted to finance and provide basic services such as health, education, telecommunications, safe water and modern sanitation. Adequate access to these services enhances development. Public services are a key determinant of quality of life that is not measured in per capita income. They are also an important element of any poverty reduction strategy. Thus, improving public service delivery is one of the biggest challenges in the continent. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Citizen satisfaction; Municipalities; Public evaluation; Public policy; Public sector; Public service delivery; Public services; South Africa,civil society; community development; electricity supply; government; health care; population distribution; public sector; public service; service provision; social housing; social policy; spatial distribution; water supply; South Africa,2-s2.0-84856797355

CCM is an excellent lens through which to examine the complex interactions of religious faith, community sentiment, and popular music practices in the contemporary US. I explain how CCM performs the 'pastoral' task of reinforcing Christian faith in an evangelical megachurch in the suburbs of Sacramento, California. I argue that a monthly concert series not only guides evangelical Christians in their 'walk', but also helps constitute the flock by building a sense of community. I suggest three spatial analytics to understand CCM's pastoral role: the place of the suburb, the sacred space of the church coffeehouse, and the body. At all three scales of analysis, the musical and religious practices of CCM at one suburban church spiritualize the everyday lives of the participants. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Christianity; community; everyday life; music; religion; suburb,Christianity; cultural influence; religion; spatial analysis; suburban area; California; Sacramento; United States,2-s2.0-84861126920

Then, we introduce our original method of opinion classification and we test the presented algorithm on real world datasets acquired from popular Polish social networks, reporting on the results.

On a theoretical level, such effects of weather are justified in two ways: by reconstructing both the influence of weather on a person's mood and sentiment and the effect of a person's mood on their assessment of situations and issues. In order to test the relationship between weather conditions and assessments empirically, ALLBUS data are linked to region-specific weather data, ""nice"" and ""bad"" survey days are identified; and their influence on people's assessment of the future economic climate and on their satisfaction with democracy and with the performance of the federal government is examined. The analyses indicate a positive influence of nice weather and a negative influence of bad weather on the assessment of these three issues. Individuals who were interviewed on particularly sunny days had an above-average satisfaction with democracy and the work of government and estimated the economic climate more positively, while persons who were interviewed on rainy days assessed the three issues more negatively. These findings introduce interesting implications for scientific and commercial survey research. © Lucius & Lucius Verlag Stuttgart.",ALLBUS; Attitudes; Economic prospects; Public opinion; Satisfaction with democracy; Satisfaction with government performance; Survey research; Weather,,2-s2.0-80052730958

It criminalizes the threat to do something that would not be criminal if one did it. There exists a rich literature on the issue, with many prominent legal scholars offering their accounts. Each theorist has his own explanation as to why the blackmail offense exists. Most theories seek to justify the position that blackmail is a moral wrong and claim to offer an account that reflects widely shared moral intuitions. But the theories make widely varying assertions about what those shared intuitions are, while also lacking any evidence to support the assertions. This Article summarizes the results of an empirical study designed to test the competing theories of blackmail to see which best accords with prevailing sentiment. Using a variety of scenarios designed to isolate and test the various criteria different theorists have put forth as ""the"" key to blackmail, this study reveals which (if any) of the various theories of blackmail proposed to date truly reflects laypeople's moral judgment. Blackmail is not only a common subject of scholarly theorizing but also a common object of criminal prohibition. Every American jurisdiction criminalizes blackmail, although there is considerable variation in its formulation. The Article reviews the American statutes and describes the three general approaches these provisions reflect. The empirical study of lay intuitions also allows an assessment of which of these statutory approaches (if any) captures the community's views, thereby illuminating the extent to which existing law generates results that resonate with, or deviate from, popular moral sentiment. The analyses provide an opportunity to critique the existing theories of blackmail and to suggest a refined theory that best expresses lay intuitions. The present project also reveals the substantial conflict between community views and much existing legislation, indicating recommendations for legislative reform. Finally, the Article suggests lessons that such studies and their analyses offer for criminal law and theory.",,,2-s2.0-79952956592

However, not all relevant articles for the query may be interesting to a user. For example, if the article is old or yields little new information, the article would be uninteresting. Relevance scores do not take into account what makes an article interesting, which would vary from user to user. Although methods such as collaborative filtering have been shown to be effective in recommendation systems, in a limited user environment, there are not enough users that would make collaborative filtering effective. A general framework, called iScore, is presented for defining and measuring the ""interestingness"" of articles, incorporating user-feedback. iScore addresses the various aspects of what makes an article interesting, such as topic relevance, uniqueness, freshness, source reputation, and writing style. It employs various methods, such as multiple topic tracking, online parameter selection, language models, clustering, sentiment analysis, and phrase extraction to measure these features. Due to varying reasons that users hold about why an article is interesting, an online feature selection method in naïve Bayes is also used to improve recommendation results. iScore can outperform traditional IR techniques by as much as 50.7%. iScore and its components are evaluated in the news recommendation task using three datasets from Yahoo!

Prior information extracted from English sentiment lexicons through machine translation are incorporated into LSM model learning, where preferences on expectations of sentiment labels of those lexicon words are expressed using generalized expectation criteria. An efficient parameter estimation procedure using variational Bayes is presented. Experimental results on the Chinese product reviews show that the weakly-supervised LSM model performs comparably to supervised classifiers such as Support vector Machines with an average of 81% accuracy achieved over a total of 5484 review documents. Moreover, starting with a generic sentiment lexicon, the LSM model is able to extract highly domain-specific polarity words from text. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.",Cross-lingual sentiment analysis; Generalized expectation; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Latent sentiment model (LSM),Data mining; Information retrieval; Statistics; Generalized expectation; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Latent sentiment model (LSM); Machine translations; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Supervised classifiers; Supervised methods; Natural language processing systems,2-s2.0-85025150063

The correspondence between Romain Rolland, the 'Christian without a church', and Freud, the 'atheist Jew', is full of Spinozian reminiscences that nourish their works of this period and are underpinned by their mutual transference. The Future of an Illusion is written according to a Spinozian blueprint and aims at replacing religion, qualified as superstition, by psychoanalysis. A quotation from Heine, 'brother in unbelief', is a direct reference to Spinoza. Concurring with Freud's critiques of dogmas and churches, Rolland proposes an analysis of the 'oceanic feeling' as a basis of the religious sentiment. Freud replies with Civilization and Its Discontents. In 1936, on the occasion of Rolland's 70th birthday, Freud sends him an open letter, A disturbance of memory on the Acropolis, where the strange feeling that he has experienced in front of the Parthenon refers inter alia to his double culture: Jewish and German. In the light of this correspondence, the creation of psychoanalysis turns out to be a quest for the sacred that has disappeared in modernity; Freud, though, was able to find it inside man's unconscious. © 2009 Institute of Psychoanalysis.",History of psychoanalysis; Metapsychology; Research,"Austria; France; history; human; literature; Netherlands; philosophy; psychoanalysis; psychoanalytic theory; religion; review; writing; Austria; Correspondence as Topic; Drama; France; Freudian Theory; History, 17th Century; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Humans; Judaism; Medicine in Literature; Netherlands; Philosophy; Psychoanalysis; Psychoanalytic Theory; Religion and Psychology",2-s2.0-74549146175

Virginia, the site for many of the most reactionary forms of anti-immigrant ordinances, is one case in point. In this paper we use data from the 2007 Virginia Survey of Anti-Immigrant Sentiment (N = 1072) conducted on the eve of the US Senate deliberations over immigration reform. Our analysis uses fixed effects models to evaluate the explanatory power of three of the dominant explanations of anti-immigrant sentiment: group threat, contact, and cultural perspectives. Our findings reveal two key points. First, although we do find scattered evidence in support of the contact and group threat approaches, evidence affirming the cultural approach seems particularly strong. Second, variables emphasized by these separate models interact in significant and interesting ways, suggesting the need to integrate these competing perspectives into fuller and more powerful models that specify how local cultural characteristics moderate the effects of macro-structural conditions. © 2009 International Sociological Association Research Committee 28 on Social Stratification and Mobility.",Anti-immigrant sentiment; Discrimination; Immigration; Nativism; Prejudice; Racial and ethnic relations,,2-s2.0-71949096688

Along with methodological development, stylistics has expanded its scope into new areas of application such as authorship profiling and sentiment analysis in addition to conventional areas such as authorship attribution and genre-based text classification. Among these, computational sociolinguistics, which aims at providing a systematic and solid basis for sociolinguistic analysis using machine learning and linguistically-motivated features, is a potentially important area. In this study we showed the effectiveness of the random forests classifier for such tasks by applying it to Japanese prime ministers' Diet speeches. The results demonstrated that our method successfully extracted the speaker-specific expressions of two Japanese prime ministers, and enabled us to investigate their political styles in a systematic manner. The method can be applied to sociolinguistic analysis of various other types of texts, and in this way, this study will contribute to developing the area of computational sociolinguistics. © 2009 ASIS&T.",,Analysis of various; Authorship attribution; Functional expression; Machine-learning; Random forests; Sentiment analysis; Solid basis; Text classification; Learning systems; Text processing; Linguistics,2-s2.0-67650917685

It analyzes the regulatory environment in England in which their ideas achieved considerable prominence, emphasizing crucial differences in the visions of 'science' embraced by the two men. By highlighting their different claims to science, this article outlines their respective legacies in criminal identification arenas, and isolates unique dangers associated with each. Those dangers variously alert us to the importance of questioning a persistent, if often implicit, sentiment within much criminal justice thinking; namely, by identifying individual criminals, or criminal types, justice systems effectively address the problem of crime. Against this approach, and resonant with a critical criminology in search of less exclusionary ways to govern, the following analysis considers criminal identification not as a discovery but a creation. In so doing, it seeks to re-politicize current practices of criminalization, challenge claims to the purported scientific impartiality of criminal identification and embrace the possibility of justice beyond a dominant reflex to create criminals. © 2009 SAGE Publications.",Alphonse Bertillon; Anthropometry; Criminal accusation; Criminal identification; Criminal types; Criminology and eugenics; Francis Galton; Governance and crime; Science studies; Sociology of science,,2-s2.0-64749110371

Petitions have been publicly registered, municipal plebiscites have occurred, and media attention is growing. There is now concern among policy leaders whether the practice is acceptable to Canadians. As a result, this study asks: What are public opinions on CWF? Methods: Data were collected in April 2008 from 1,005 Canadian adults by means of a national telephone interview survey using random digit dialling and computer-assisted telephone interview technology. Descriptive and bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were undertaken. Results: Approximately 1 in 2 Canadian adults surveyed knew about CWF. Of these, 80% understood its intended use, approximately 60% believed that it was both safe and effective, and 62% supported the idea of having fluoride added to their local drinking water. Those with greater incomes [OR=1.4; p<0.001] and education [OR=1.6; p<0.001] were more likely to know about CWF. Those with greater incomes [OR=1.3; p<0.03] and those who visited the dentist more frequently [OR=1.8; p<0.002] were more likely to support CWF, and those with children [OR=0.5; p<0.02], those who accessed dental care using public insurance [OR=0.2; p<0.03], and those who avoided fluoride [OR=0.04; p<0.001] were less likely to support CWF. Conclusion: It appears that Canadians still support CWF. In moving forward, policy leaders will need to attend to two distinct challenges: the influence of anti-fluoride sentiment, and the potential risks created by avoiding fluoride. © Canadian Public Health Association, 2009.

The diversity perspective holds that ethnocultural heterogeneity undermines social solidarity, and consequently expects social solidarity to be weaker in more heterogeneous societies. In the diversity logic, social solidarity should have declined in Western societies as these societies have become more diverse due to continuous immigration. Postmaterialism theory, by contrast, posits a positive link between postmaterialism and social solidarity, and would expect social solidarity to have increased because of rising levels of postmaterialism across the Western world. This article found no relation between diversity and social solidarity at either the individual or the national level in cross-sectional analyses of WVS and EVS survey data. Neither was the diversity argument supported by trend data on opinions about the poor. The positive relations between postmaterialism and social solidarity on the other hand did confirm the postmaterialism perspective. Still, as postmaterialism contributed little to explaining the variance in social solidarity at the individual level and as there was no connection between postmaterialism and social solidarity at the macro-level, it can be questioned whether the solidaristic sentiments expressed by postmaterialists are sufficiently deep and lasting to underpin robust welfare policies. © 2009 Sage Publications.",Ethnic diversity; Postmaterialism; Solidarity; Trust; Welfare state,material culture; social theory; survey; theoretical study,2-s2.0-59649099790

The data set comes out with an initial return mean of 88.67%, an average market-adjusted initial return of 89.61% and an average market-adjusted log-return of 59.18%, which are significantly lower than the results of former empirical studies. This downward trend of IPO returns reinforces the explanation that a transition economy reduces its cheap state assets sell-off in line with the maturing of its capital market. Based on the results of correlation and regression analysis, we ascertain that the IPO underpricing is overwhelmingly caused by the excess demand and the generally positive sentiment in China's secondary/after-IPO market for new shares, resulting in high trading turnover on the first listing day. This is strengthened by the finding that more initial returns could be generated on the SHSE than on the SZSE, as a result of strong public interest in blue chip IPOs on the SHSE.",,capital market; correlation; data set; empirical analysis; interest rate; regression analysis; transitional economy,2-s2.0-36749063100

On the one hand, one witnesses the growing intensity of economic integration, and the parallel proliferation of formal mechanisms of communication and coordination across the border. On the other hand, conflicting values and mutual distrust, particularly over issues of human rights, democracy and autonomy, have galvanised demonstrations and protests of monumental scale during the period. How could this have happened? What is wrong with the communication? And what can be done to improve it? While this chapter argues that Beijing's misguided Hong Kong policy and the indifference to social and political realities of Tung Cheehwa's administration are the major culprits in provoking this growing tension, the painful psychological adjustment of Hong Kong people may also obstruct the emergence of a cordial interaction. Although many local people still maintain a sense of superiority over Mainlanders, their sentiment is very much offset by the economic reality of growing dependence on China's economy. Such a mixed feeling may nurture some kind of social distance between people across the border. The chapter is divided into three parts. The first part provides a general overview of the extent of social and economic integration between Hong Kong and the Mainland. The second part sketches out the formal communication channels between the two administrations. It is followed by an analysis of the irony of the growing tension between Hong Kong and the Mainland in spite of the growing integration and bureaucratic exchanges. The roles of Beijing, the Tung administration and the Hong Kong people are critically examined. © Hong Kong University Press 2007. All rights reserved.",,,2-s2.0-77954839256

Design/methodology/approach An interpretive qualitative analysis of focus group data is used to explore the topic. Focus group participants were strategically selected from a larger sample to be representative on a broad range of demographic variables. Findings There is considerable negativity associated with spending money on mobile content owing to the following factors: The mobile phone is perceived primarily as a communication tool. Money spent on the mobile phone for uses not related to communication is often perceived as wasted. The mobile phone is seen as an inferior channel for entertainment and information when compared to television, magazines, and the internet. Consumers are wary of deceptive advertising practices for mobile content. Many consumers are able to access “free” content. Research limitations/implications Future research should focus on comparisons to consumers in other countries and on the relative pervasiveness of the factors identified in this study in the general population. Practical implications Considerable negativity towards spending money on content suggests problems with revenue models relying on direct sales of content. However, “free” content is often perceived very positively. Advertiser-sponsored models and branded “value add” models may prove to be effective ways of leveraging this positive sentiment. Originality/value The paper provides a unique examination of the link between perceptions of mobile content and the perceived role of the mobile phone in everyday life, and draws important conclusions regarding the implementation of successful revenue models. The conclusions reached are likely to be of interest to mobile application developers, content aggregators, content owners, and mobile telecommunication companies. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Australia; Cordless telephone systems; Marketing strategy; Mobile communication systems; Youth,,2-s2.0-84992929404

Each wave shows a nested phase of enthusiasm and of scepticism. During the first wave, biological news has little salience and evaluation parallels the attitudes to general science. During the second wave, genetic engineering becomes a major news item and its phase of evaluation separates from that of general science and technology. While general science improves its public profile, biotechnology becomes publicly controversial during the 1990s. Public perceptions, as far as data is available, follows the changing trends of the press with some lag. For both waves of public sentiment, the paper highlights events and topics that fuelled public imagination and that led to the present mix of controversies over genetic technology in food production, biomedicine and law enforcement. The watershed events of 1996 (GM soya) and 1997 (Dolly the sheep) did not initiate the trend changes which started already in the mid-1980s, but catalysed an already established trend towards more sceptical sentiments in the late 1990s. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.",,article; attitude; biomedicine; biotechnology; catalysis; fermentation; food industry; gene mutation; genetic engineering; genetics; human; law enforcement; medical research; philosophy; priority journal; science; sociobiology; sociology; technology; time series analysis; Ovis aries,2-s2.0-34247525640

THE BASIC THEORY Alexander the Great “put Calisthenes to death in torture, for having refused to adore him in the Persian manner” (VI.iii.32). According to Smith, I judge Alexander in two ways. First, I imagine what I would feel if I were in Alexander's place and was presented with Calisthenes's refusal. This act of imagination does not produce in me the affront Alexander feels, and when I do not react to the refusal as Alexander does, I judge Alexander to lack “propriety.” Secondly, I imagine what I would feel were I in Calisthenes's place. I would feel resentment, and do so now, irrespective of what Calisthenes actually feels (II.i.2.4, II.i.3.1, II.i.5.11). If I have found that Alexander lacks propriety, I now judge him guilty of “demerit” and deserving punishment. © Cambridge University Press 2006.",,,2-s2.0-84873446104
